    An AttributeError was raised at the MDOChain construction,
    during the creation of the MDOChain grammar,
    from the disciplines ones.
    The issue was observed when specific conditions were met:
        - two or more disciplines.
        - couplings defined ONLY with JSON Grammar at discipline level.
        - couplings set as non-required in the JSON Grammar.

    Such a condition was not properly handled
    and led to an unexpected AttributeException error.
