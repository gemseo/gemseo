# Machine learning examples

This section illustrates the features of the [gemseo.mlearning][gemseo.mlearning] package:

- how to create a machine learning model for classification, clustering or regression,
- how to transform the data,
- how to assess the quality of a model,
- how to tune a model.

This package is particularly useful for creating a surrogate model, as a [SurrogateDiscipline][gemseo.disciplines.surrogate.SurrogateDiscipline] wraps a regression model built from it. However, for those who are not very comfortable with machine learning and for those who are essentially interested in the surrogate modelling, starting with [the examples][surrogate-discipline-examples] about the [SurrogateDiscipline][gemseo.disciplines.surrogate.SurrogateDiscipline] should be more relevant.
