Version 6.1.0 (2025-03-17)
**************************

Added
-----

- The Gantt chart created by the ``create_gantt_chart`` function displays the time unit and the legend for the blue and red areas.
  `#216 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/216>`_
- The ``BiLevel`` formulation and its derived classes now include settings for the scenario adapters used to
  run the sub-scenarios. These settings are:

  - ``keep_opt_history``: To control whether the databases of the sub-scenarios are be kept in memory after each execution.
  - ``save_opt_history``: To control whether the databases of the sub-scenarios are saved to the disk after each execution. The database files use the ``Scenario.name`` attribute of each sub-scenario to prefix the name of the files. Use this setting if the sub-scenarios are running in parallel.
  - ``naming``: To select the id to append to the prefix of each database file when ``save_opt_history=True``. See ``NameGenerator.Naming`` for more details.
  `#839 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/839>`_
- In ``LinearCombination``, the inputs are averaged when ``input_coefficients`` is empty and the new argument ``average`` is ``True`` (default: ``False``).
  `#924 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/924>`_
- New discipline RetryDiscipline: it wraps a discipline to retry the execution several times. It tries to execute the discipline, if it raises an exception then it retries up to a maximum number of attempts. It can pass a tuple of exceptions that, if one of them raised, do not retry the execution.
  `#927 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/927>`_
- The normalization of integer design variables can be switched on and off
  thanks to the property ``DesignSpace.normalize_integer_variables``.
  `#1000 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1000>`_
- The ``VariableRenamer`` class can be used to create translators,
  which are translation dictionaries
  of the form ``{discipline_name: {variable_name: new_variable_name}}``
  from tuples, dictionaries, CSV files and spreadsheets.
  These dictionaries can then be used
  to create a ``RemappingDiscipline`` or a ``NameMapping`` data processor.
  `#1005 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1005>`_
- Jacobian can be approximated hybridly by defining certain elements of the Jacobian within the discipline and then calling the ``linearize`` method and passing one of the hybrid Approximation modes: ``HYBRID_FINITE_DIFFERENCES``, ``HYBRID_CENTERED_DIFFERENCES``, ``HYBRID_COMPLEX_STEP``
  `#1166 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1166>`_
- The ``compare_dict_of_arrays`` function now handles ``NaNs`` via the ``nan_are_equal`` argument. By default, ``nan_are_equal=False`` that is ``NaN != NaN`` in the component-wise comparison.
  `#1167 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1167>`_
- ``PCERegressor.predict_jacobian_against_substitute`` can predict the Jacobian
  with respect to inputs substitute at a given input point
  when the learning dataset includes gradient information;
  similar attributes are available for the Jacobian of the mean, standard deviation and variance.
  `#1285 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1285>`_
- Documentation and examples about the classes ``ODEDiscipline`` and ``ODEProblem``.
  `#1302 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1302>`_
- The ``SequenceTransformer`` class now has a ``set_bounds`` method which allows to set lower and/or upper bounds for the computed transformed iterates.
  When components of the iterates fall outside of the bounds, they are projected onto the appropriate bound.
  The bounds must be provided has NumPy arrays with same size as the iterates.
  The ``BaseMDASolver``, ``MDAChain`` and ``MDASequential`` classes now have a ``set_bounds`` method which allows to set lower and/or upper bound for each resolved variables (coupling or state).
  The bounds must be provided as a mapping from variable names to tuple of the form ``(lower_bound, upper_bound)``, where ``lower_bound`` and/or ``upper_bound`` must be NumPy arrays with the same size as the resolved variable.
  `#1358 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1358>`_
- So far,
  the methods ``BaseScenario.to_dataset``, ``EvaluationProblem.to_dataset`` and ``Database.to_dataset``
  export the ``Database`` to a ``Dataset``.
  Now,
  they also store at the key ``"input_space"`` of the dictionary ``Dataset.misc``
  the input space (of type ``DesignSpace``) used to generate the data.
  `#1373 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1373>`_
- The mNBI example on the Binh-Korn problem now illustrates the user defined refinement of the Pareto front.
  `#1379 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1379>`_
- The DOE algorithms have a new option,
  named ``"eval_func"`` (default: ``True``),
  to sample the functions computing output data.
  By deactivating it,
  only functions calculating Jacobian data are sampled
  if ``eval_jac`` is ``True`` (default: ``False``).
  `#1380 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1380>`_
- MDA now has a new setting ``max_consecutive_unsuccessful_iterations`` and corresponding stopping criteria that allows to break the MDA loop when a given number of consecutive unsuccessful iterations is reached.
  An iteration is unsuccessful if the normalized residual norm has increased.
  The default value is 8.
  `#1381 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1381>`_
- ``EmpiricalToleranceInterval`` allows to estimate tolerance intervals from samples without any distribution assumption.
- ``EmpiricalStatistics.compute_tolerance_interval``, ``EmpiricalStatistics.compute_a_value`` and ``EmpiricalStatistics.compute_b_value`` are now implemented.
  `#1382 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1382>`_
- The ``OptAsMDOScenario`` can make a mono-disciplinary optimization problem multi-disciplinary.
  `#1399 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1399>`_
- The function ``rename_discipline_variables`` can be used to rename some discipline variables.
  `#1422 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1422>`_
- The grammars have a new dictionary-like attribute, called ``descriptions``, to set the descriptions of the elements.
  `#1424 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1424>`_
- ``MDOScenario`` supports DOE algorithms, making it possible to use a DOE and an optimizer with the same scenario.
  `#1436 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1436>`_
- Add an example to create multi-point processes using namespaces.
  `#1448 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1448>`_
- The ``get_discipline_variable_properties`` function returns the properties of the input and output discipline variables, such as the original name, the current name, and the current name without namespace.
- The module ``gemseo.disciplines.utils`` has been merged into ``gemseo.utils.discipline``.
  `#1458 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1458>`_
- Added a ``protocol`` argument to the ``to_pickle`` function and to the ``deserialize_and_run`` command line for specifying the pickling protocol.
  `#1467 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1467>`_
- The ``MDOScenarioAdapter`` now includes the argument ``save_opt_history``
  (default: ``False``)
  to save the optimization history of each run to the disk.
  This setting is also accessible via the attribute of the same name.
  `#1470 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1470>`_
- ``BaseDistributionFitter`` is the base class to fit a probability distribution to data, from which the ``OTDistributionFitter`` class using the OpenTURNS library is derived.
- ``SPDistributionFitter`` is the class to fit a probability distribution to data using the SciPy library; the fitting criteria are the following statistical significance tests: Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises, Filliben and Kolmogorov-Smirnov.
  `#1471 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1471>`_
- The class ``NameGenerator`` generates unique names based on the given ``NameGenerator.Naming`` through the
  ``generate_name()`` method.
  `#1472 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1472>`_
- The wing weight problem has been added to benchmark and illustrate UQ algorithms; see ``gemseo.problems.uncertainty.wing_weight``.
  `#1473 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1473>`_
- "BiLevelBCD" is a formulation derived from "BiLevel" that uses the Block Coordinate Descent algorithm to solve the lower-optimization problem.

  `#1360 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1360>`_
- Normalizing a vector, relative to a design space of integer variables,

  `#1374 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1374>`_
- The ``log_convergence`` attribute of ``MDASequential`` is cascaded to the sub-MDAs.
  `#1375 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1375>`_
- ``TaylorDiscipline`` uses the same order of input variables as the original discipline.
  `#1377 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1377>`_
- The attributes ``input_names`` and ``output_names`` of ``AutoPyDiscipline``, which were supposed to be non-modifiable, are now read-only and will be removed in the next major release.
- The attributes ``py_func`` and ``py_jac`` of ``AutoPyDiscipline``, which were supposed to be non-modifiable, are now read-only.
- The attribute ``sizes`` appearing in the documentation of ``AutoPyDiscipline`` has been removed as it was not used (not even initialized).
- ``AutoPyDiscipline`` no longer logs a warning message when ``py_func`` has no type hints, neither for arguments nor return variables.
  `#1386 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1386>`_
- Data processors are now compatible with namespaces and ``NameMapping``.
- ``NameMapping`` is now compatible with the new way of implementing the ``Discipline._run`` method since |g| 6,
  i.e. using input data passed as a dictionary and returning output data as a dictionary.
  `#1406 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1406>`_
- The methods ``plot_boxplot``, ``plot_cdf`` and ``plot_pdf`` of ``EmpiricalStatistics`` save one figure per variable,
  instead of the figure for the last variable only.
  For ``plot_foo``, the file name for the variable called ``"bar"`` is ``"foo_bar"``.
  `#1413 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1413>`_
- A broken example, relying on an older implementation of ``ODEDiscipline`` and no longer functional, has been removed from the documentation.
  `#1426 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1426>`_

  the variable is an output of the MDA1, the MDA2, or the sub-scenarios.
  `#1434 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1434>`_
- ``TaylorDiscipline`` is now deterministic (independent of the Python hash seed).
  `#1437 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1437>`_
- The ``copy`` method of a grammar was partly returning a shallow copy which did not have a consistent state.
  It now returns a deep copy.
  `#1438 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1438>`_
- The method ``OptimizationResult.from_optimization_problem()`` properly returns an ``OptimizationResult`` object when giving an ``OptimizationProblem`` as an argument.
  `#1450 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1450>`_

  `#1459 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1459>`_
- The ``MDOScenarioAdapter`` now includes the argument ``naming`` which allows to decide whether to use
  integers or uuid's for database names when exporting them to the disk. The ``"UUID"`` strategy is the only
  multiprocessing-safe option and it shall always be used when running the adapter inside a parallel execution context.
  Before this change, different sub-processes would overwrite the database files and the data from some runs would be
  lost.
  `#1472 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1472>`_
- The documentation has been updated to inform the end-user
  not to use ``namespaces_separator`` (default: ``":"``) in discipline variable names,
  as |g| uses this special character  to separate the original names from the namespace associated with these variables.
  The end-user must never add the namespaces by hand
  but always use the dedicated methods
  such as ``Discipline.add_namespace_to_input``, ``Discipline.add_namespace_to_output`` and ``BaseGrammar.add_namespace``.
  `#1476 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1476>`_

  `#1696 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1696>`_
- Warnings issued from some pydantic models.
- ``PolynomialRegressor_Settings``: the default value of ``degree`` is a positive integer.
- The minimum required versions of the dependencies of the |g| packages were not up to date.

Changed
-------

- BREAKING CHANGES:

  - It is no longer necessary to set the option ``keep_opt_history`` to ``True``
    to save the optimization database to the disk after each execution of the ``MDOScenarioAdapter``.
    If you wish to save the optimization database to the disk, use the option ``save_opt_history`` instead. Concerning
    ``keep_opt_history``, you may set it to ``False`` if you are not interested in accessing the databases in memory or to
    ``True`` otherwise. This setting will not affect the saving of the optimization database to the disk. Storing many
    databases in memory can lead to high memory consumption.
    From now on,
    the option ``opt_history_file_prefix`` only sets the prefix of the files to be saved and no longer controls whether the
    optimization databases are saved to the disk or not. You shall set the option ``save_opt_history`` to ``True`` if you
    wish to save the optimization database to the disk.
    If it is not provided,
    the default prefix is ``MDOScenarioAdapter.DEFAULT_DATABASE_FILE_PREFIX``.
    `#1470 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1470>`_
  - ``NameMapping`` is no longer compatible with the way of implementing the ``Discipline._run`` method before |g| 6,
    i.e. getting input data from the ``local_data`` and writing output data in the ``local_data``.
    `#1406 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1406>`_
- In ``LinearCombination``, the default value of the ``input_size`` argument is ``1`` rather than ``None``, which in practice does not change the definition of the discipline.
- In ``LinearCombination``, the default value of the ``input_coefficients`` argument is an empty dictionary rather than ``None``, which in practice does not change the definition of the discipline.
  `#924 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/924>`_
- Integer design variables are no longer normalized by default.
  `#1000 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1000>`_
- API change: In ``gemseo.problems.mdo.scalable.data_driven.discipline``, rename ``ScalableDiscipline`` into ``DataDrivenScalableDiscipline``.
  `#1092 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1092>`_
- Added documentation about ODEDiscipline and ODEProblem.
  `#1302 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1302>`_
- Changed input and output names of ODEDiscipline
  `#1353 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1353>`_
- ``PCERegressor`` uses a probability space of type ``ParameterSpace`` to define the input random variables.
  Now,
  this probability space can be passed to the argument ``data`` of type ``IODataset``,
  by means of its dictionary attribute ``misc``, *e.g.* ``io_dataset.misc["input_space"] = probability_space``.
  When the ``IODataset`` is the result of sampling on the ``ParameterSpace``,
  using the ``sample_disciplines`` function or the ``DOEScenario`` with its ``to_dataset`` method for example,
  this ``ParameterSpace``  is automatically stored in ``io_dataset.misc["input_space"]``.
  `#1373 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1373>`_
- The signature of the ``MDAGSNewton`` constructor is now the same as all the other MDA classes.
  The ``MDAGSNewton_Settings`` settings model has two new fields, namely ``gauss_seidel_settings`` and ``newton_settings``, to provide the settings of the ``MDAGaussSeidel`` and ``MDANewtonRaphson`` respectively.
  These settings can be provided either as key/value pairs or with the appropriate settings model.
  `#1375 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1375>`_
- The data processor ``NameMapping`` can be used to rename only certain input and output variables.
  `#1407 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1407>`_
- The ``BiLevel`` and ``BiLevelBCD`` formulations now log a warning when
  a coupling variable is removed from the design space.
  `#1434 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1434>`_
- At the end of its execution,
  a scenario logs its time execution calculated from its ``execution_statistics.duration``,
  to be consistent with its ``execution_statistics``.
  If these ``execution_statistics`` are disabled,
  the time execution is not logged.
  `#1445 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1445>`_
- Updated the default protocol for the ``to_pickle`` function to ``HIGHEST_PROTOCOL``.
  `#1467 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1467>`_
- The class ``DirectoryCreator`` now inherits from ``NameGenerator``. Its argument ``directory_naming_method`` will be
  deprecated in the next major release of GEMSEO in favor of ``naming``.
  The class ``DirectoryNamingMethod`` is now an alias for ``NameGenerator.Naming``. It will be deprecated in
  the next major release of GEMSEO in favor of ``NameGenerator.Naming``.
  `#1472 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1472>`_
- The ``BiLevel`` formulation has been refactored in order to
  simplify the ``BiLevelBCD`` integration or any other formulation
  that may inherit from it.
  `#1794 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1794>`_
- ``ExecutionStatistics.record``: now use ``ExecutionStatistics.record_execution`` and ``ExecutionStatistics.record_linearization``.
- ``ExecutionStatistics.n_calls``:  now use ``ExecutionStatistics.n_executions``.
- ``ExecutionStatistics.n_calls_linearize``: now use ``ExecutionStatistics.n_linearizations``.
- ``ExecutionStatus.run``: now use  ``ExecutionStatistics.handle``.
- ``ExecutionStatus.linearize``: now use ``ExecutionStatistics.handle``.
- The integer type of a design variable is now ``int64`` instead of ``int32``,
  this matches the type of python ``int`` and the default type of integer in NumPy 2 which we will support later.
- ``base_cache.DATA_COMPARATOR``: now use ``BaseCache.compare_dict_of_arrays``.
- ``PolynomialRegressor``: specifying the ``degree`` is no longer mandatory; the default value is ``2``.

Version 6.0.0 (2024-11-08)
**************************

Added
-----

Optimization & DOE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``HessianHistory`` is an ``OptPostProcessor`` to visualize the history of the diagonal of the Hessian matrix of the objective.
  `#463 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/463>`_
- The optimizer ``MultiStart`` enables multi-start optimization, by combining an optimization algorithm and a DOE algorithm.
  `#645 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/645>`_
- ``EvaluationProblem``, of which ``OptimizationProblem`` is a subclass, allows to evaluate ``MDOFunction`` s over a ``DesignSpace`` and store the evaluations in a ``Database``.
  `#678 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/678>`_
- The drivers can now take the option ``store_jacobian`` (default: ``True``). When set to ``False``, the Jacobian matrices are not saved in the database.
  This reduces the RAM requirements for large optimization problems.
  `#1094 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1094>`_
- The maximum dimension of a design space to be logged
  can be passed as the optional argument ``max_design_space_dimension_to_log`` of ``BaseDriverLibrary.execute``.
  Hence it can be passed to any DOE library or optimization library as the option ``max_design_space_dimension_to_log``.
  `#1163 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1163>`_
- The ``MNBI`` multi-objective algorithm can be used to refine a specific part of the Pareto front.
  `#1171 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1171>`_
- The ``sample_disciplines`` function allows to sample a system of disciplines based on an MDO formulation (default: MDF) and DOE settings (formerly in ``gemseo-mlearning``).
  `#1180 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1180>`_
- ``ProblemFunction`` is an ``MDOFunction`` wrapping another ``MDOFunction``. Its ``func`` and ``jac`` methods call the corresponding methods of the underlying ``MDOFunction`` after pre-processing input value and before post-processing output value. Each function attached to an ``EvaluationProblem`` is replaced by a ``ProblemFunction`` when calling ``EvaluationProblem.preprocess_functions``. Calls to the function can be counted via the ``enable_statistics`` and ``n_calls`` attributes.
  `#1222 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1222>`_
- ``BaseToleranceTester`` is a new base class to check whether a tolerance criterion is met, with specific subclasses: ``DesignToleranceTester``, ``ObjectiveToleranceTester`` and ``KKTConditionsTester``.
  `#1224 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1224>`_
- All the figures generated by ``OptHistoryView`` have a vertical red line representing the optimum iteration.
  `#1236 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1236>`_
- Add support of SciPy's version of the ``COBYQA`` algorithm.
  `#1261 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1261>`_
- SciPy's algorithms ``L-BFGS-B``, ``NELDER-MEAD``, ``TNC`` and ``SLSQP`` support the ``stop_crit_n_x`` option.
  `#1265 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1265>`_
- ``AlgorithmDescription`` and its derived classes now include the class attribute ``AlgorithmDescription.settings`` to
  store algorithm-specific settings. This is useful specially for algorithm libraries that wrap different algorithms in a
  single class.
  The following linear solvers have been added to ``ScipyLinalgAlgos``:

  - Conjugate Gradient (CG),
  - Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (CGS),
  - Generalized Conjugate Residual with Optimal Truncation (GCROT),
  - Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimum Residual (TFQMR).
  The ``ScipyLinprog`` library now handles integer variables.
  `#1450 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1450>`_

MDO processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The MDA settings can now be passed at instantiation as a Pydantic model as well as key/value pairs.
  The following properties has been added to ``BaseMDASolver``:

  -  ``acceleration_method``,
  -  ``over_relaxation_factor``.
  `#1322 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1322>`_
- The ``JobSchedulerDisciplineWrapper`` and the ``deserialize_and_run`` entry point implement ``_compute_jacobian``.
  `#1191 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1191>`_
- ``RemappingDiscipline`` accepts an empty name mapping, in which case no remapping is applied.
  `#1197 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1197>`_
- ``BackupSettings`` is a dataclass to pass the backup settings to functions relying on ``BaseScenario.set_optimization_history_backup``, e.g. ``sample_disciplines`` and ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis.compute_samples``.
  `#1204 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1204>`_

  `#1264 <https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo/-/issues/1264>`_
- ``BaseAlgorithmLibrary`` and its derived classes no longer allow users to pass settings that are not included in the validation model. In the past, unknown settings were allowed to pass up to the wrapped algorithm level, which was error prone.

- ``MDOFunction`` supports elementwise multiplication and division by NumPy arrays.
- Addition, substraction, multiplication and division of a function expecting normalized inputs with a function that does not raise ``RuntimeError``.
- The function values :math:`f(x)` passed to optimizers can optionally be scaled relative to :math:`|f(x_0)|` where :math:`x_0` is the current value of the ``DesignSpace``.
  This functionality is enabled by passing a positive value :math:`\epsilon` as the option ``scaling_threshold`` of any optimizer: the function values passed to the optimizer are then :math:`f(x) / \max\{ |f(x_0)|, \epsilon \}`.
  The purpose of :math:`\epsilon` is to avoid division by a value close to zero.
  The (default) value ``None`` for the option ``scaling_threshold`` disables the scaling.

Fixed
-----

- The stratified DOE algorithms ``OT_AXIAL``, ``OT_COMPOSITE`` and ``OT_FACTORIAL`` correctly support the arguments ``n_samples``, ``centers``, ``dimension`` and ``levels``.
