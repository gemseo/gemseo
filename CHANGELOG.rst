Version 3.2.2 (March 2022)
**************************

Fixed
-----

Version 3.2.1 (November 2021)
*****************************

Fixed
-----

- Missing package dependency declaration.

Version 3.2.0 (November 2021)
*****************************

Added
-----

Algorithms and numerical computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The matrix linear problem solvers libraries are now handled by a Factory and can then be extended by plugins.
- MDA warns if it stops when reaching ``max_mda_iter`` but before reaching the tolerance criteria.
- The convergence of an MDA can be logged.
- Add max line search steps option in scipy L-BFGS-B
- An analytical Jacobian can be checked for subsets of input and output names and components.
- An analytical Jacobian can be checked from a reference file.
- Scipy global algorithms SHGO and differential evolution now handle non linear constraints.
- It is now possible to get the number of constraints not satisfied by a design in an OptimizationProblem.
- The names of the scalar constraints in an OptimizationProblem can be retrieved as a list.
- The dimensions of the outputs for functions in an OptimizationProblem are now available as a dictionary.
- The cross-validation technique can now randomize the samples before dividing them in folds.

Post processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Scatter Plot Matrix post processor now allows the user to filter non-feasible points.
- OptPostProcessor can change the size of the figures with the method execute().
- SensitivityAnalysis can plot indices with values standardized in [0,1].

UQ
~~

- MorrisAnalysis provides new indices: minimum, maximum and relative standard deviation.

Documentation and examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A button to change the tagged version of GEMSEO is available on the documentation hosted by Read the Docs.
- The documentation now includes a link to the gemseo-scilab plugin.
- ParetoFront: an example of a BiLevel scenario to compute the Pareto front has been added the examples.
- A Pareto front computation example using a bi-level scenario has been added to the documentation.

Software improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It is now possible to execute DOEScenarios in parallel on Windows. For Python versions < 3.7 and
  Numpy < 1.20.0, there is a known issue where one of the processes gets hung randomly, updating your
  environment is strongly recommended.
  This feature does not support the use of MemoryFullCache or HDF5Cache on Windows.
  The progress bar may show duplicated instances during the initialization of each subprocess, in some cases
  it may also print the conclusion of an iteration ahead of another one that was concluded first. This
  is a consequence of the pickling process and does not affect the computations of the scenario.
- A ParameterSpace can be casted into a DesignSpace.
- Plugins can be discovered via setuptools entry points.
- A dumped MDODiscipline can now be loaded with the API function import_discipline().
- Database has a name used by OptimizationProblem to name the Dataset;
  this is the name of the corresponding Scenario if any.

- Scenario, MDOScenario and DOEScenario now include the argument ``grammar_type``.
- A GrammarFactory used by MDODiscipline allows to plug new grammars for data checking.
- The coupling structure can be directly passed to an MDA.
- Database has a name used by OptimizationProblem to name the Dataset;
  this is the name of the corresponding Scenario if any.
- A dumped MDODiscipline can now be loaded with the API function ``import_discipline``.
- The name of an MDOScenarioAdapter can be defined at creation.
- The AbstractFullCache built from a Dataset has the same name as the dataset.
- The HDF5 file generated by HDF5Cache has now a version number.

Changed
-------

  and allows to change the discretization of the grid.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make OpenTURNS- and pyDOE-based full factorial DOEs work whatever the dimension and number of samples.

  Scatter Plot Matrix pages in the documentation now render the example plots correctly.

Documentation and examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  old cache files shall have to be converted, see the FAQ.
