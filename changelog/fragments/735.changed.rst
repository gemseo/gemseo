API changes:
- :meth:`.MDOFunciton.check_grad` argument ``method`` was renamed to ``approximation_mode`` and now expects to be passed an :class:`ApproximationMode`.
- For :class:`GradientApproximator` and its derived classes:
  - Renamed the class attribute ``ALIAS`` to ``_APPROXIMATION_MODE``,
  - Renamed the instance attribute ``_par_args`` to ``_parallel_args``,
- Renamed ``GradientApproximationFactory`` to :class:`GradientApproximatorFactory` and moved it to the module ``gradient_approximator_factory.py``,
- Moved the duplicated functions to ``error_estimators.py``:
  - ``finite_differences.comp_best_step``
  - ``finite_differences.compute_truncature_error``
  - ``finite_differences.compute_cancellation_error``
  - ``finite_differences.approx_hess``
  - ``derivatives_approx.comp_best_step``
  - ``derivatives_approx.compute_truncature_error``
  - ``derivatives_approx.compute_cancellation_error``
  - ``derivatives_approx.approx_hess``
  - ``comp_best_step`` was renamed to ``compute_best_step``
  - ``approx_hess`` was renamed to ``compute_hessian_approximation``
