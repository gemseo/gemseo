:attr:`.Statistics.n_variables` no longer corresponds to the number of variables in the :attr:`.Statistics.dataset` but to the number of variables considered by :class:`.Statistics`.
:attr:`.ParametricStatistics` correctly handles variables with dimension greater than one.
:meth:`.ParametricStatistics.compute_a_value` uses 0.99 as coverage level and 0.95 as confidence level.
