The boolean option ``include_weak_coupling_targets`` of ``IDF_Settings``
makes ``IDF`` include both the strong couplings and the weak couplings in the optimization problem,
in the form of optimization variables supplemented by consistency constraints (default).
Otherwise, this MDO formulation includes the strong couplings only.
