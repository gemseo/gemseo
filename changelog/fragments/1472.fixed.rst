The ``MDOScenarioAdapter`` now includes the argument ``naming`` which allows to decide whether to use
integers or uuid's for database names when exporting them to the disk. The ``"UUID"`` strategy is the only
multiprocessing-safe option and it shall always be used when running the adapter inside a parallel execution context.
Before this change, different sub-processes would overwrite the database files and the data from some runs would be
lost.
