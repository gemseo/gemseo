API changes:

- The MDAChain now takes ``inner_mda_name`` as argument instead of ``sub_mda_class``.
- The :class:`.MDF` formulation now takes ``main_mda_name`` as argument instead of ``main_mda_class`` and ``inner_mda_name`` instead of ``sub_mda_class``.
- The :class:`.BiLevel` formulation now takes ``main_mda_name`` as argument instead of ``mda_name``. It is now possible to explicitly define an ``inner_mda_name`` as well.
