``DesignSpace.dict_to_array`` returns an ``ndarray``
whose attribute ``dtype`` matches the "common ``dtype``" of the values of its ``dict`` argument ``design_values``
corresponding to the keys passed in its argument ``variables_names``.
So far, the ``dtype`` was erroneously based on all the values of ``design_values``.
