API changes:

- The :class:`.AbstractFullCache`'s getters (:meth:`~.AbstractFullCache.get_data` and :meth:`~.AbstractFullCache.get_all_data`) return one or more :class:`.CacheItem`,
that is a namedtuple with variable groups as fields.
- In :class:`.AbstractFullCache`, ``varsizes`` is renamed as :attr:`~.AbstractFullCache.names_to_sizes` and ``max_length`` as :attr:`.AbstractFullCache.MAXSIZE`,
The number of items stored in an :class:`.AbstractCache` can no longer be obtained with ``get_length``, but ``__len__``.
