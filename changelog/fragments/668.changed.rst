API change:
- Replaced the module ``parallel_execution.py`` by the package ``parallel_execution``.
- Renamed the class ``ParallelExecution`` to ``CallableParallelExecution``.
- Renamed the function ``worker`` to ``execute_workers``.
- Renamed the argument ``input_values`` to ``inputs``.
- Removed the ``ParallelExecution`` methods:
  - ``_update_local_objects``
  - ``_run_task``
  - ``_is_worker``
  - ``_filter_ordered_outputs``
  - ``_run_task_by_index``
- ``ParallelExecution`` and its derive classes always take a collection of workers and no longer a single worker.
