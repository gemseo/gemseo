API changes:

- ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis`` and its subclasses (``MorrisAnalysis``, ``SobolAnalysis``, ``CorrelationAnalysis`` and ``HSICAnalysis``) no longer compute samples at instantiation but with a specific method, namely ``compute_samples``, whose signature matches that of the previous constructor and which returns samples as an ``IODataset``. One can also instantiate these classes from existing samples and then directly use the method ``compute_indices``.
- ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis.to_pickle`` and ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis.from_pickle``: removed; instantiate ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis`` from an ``IODataset`` instead, which could typically be generated by ``BaseSensitivityAnalysis.compute_samples``.
