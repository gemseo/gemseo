The package ``gemseo.utils.metrics`` include metrics to compare two quantities:

- The base class is ``BaseMetric`` and its factory is ``MetricFactory``.
- ``BaseCompositeMetric`` is the base class for metrics relying on another metric.
- The ``ElementWiseMetric`` is a composite metric to compare two collections using an underlying metric; it returns a collection.
- ``DatasetMetric`` is a composite metric to compare two ``Dataset`` s row-wisely using an underlying metric; it returns a ``Dataset``.
- The ``MeanMetric`` is a composite metric to compare two collections using an underlying metric; it returns an array.
- The ``SquaredErrorMetric`` is a composite metric returning the squared difference between two quantities.
