``AlgorithmDescription`` and its derived classes now include the class attribute ``AlgorithmDescription.settings`` to
store algorithm-specific settings. This is useful specially for algorithm libraries that wrap different algorithms in a
single class.
The following linear solvers have been added to ``ScipyLinalgAlgos``:
- Conjugate Gradient (CG),
- Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (CGS),
- Generalized Conjugate Residual with Optimal Truncation (GCROT),
- Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimum Residual (TFQMR).
The ``ScipyLinprog`` library now handles integer variables.
