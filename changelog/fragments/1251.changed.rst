The convergence of MDAs is now checked after the execution of the disciplines instead of after the acceleration.
This change affects the absolute value of the output coupling variables when running an MDA with acceleration methods.
The difference has an order of magnitude at most equal to the MDA tolerance.
The change should be harmless in most cases but could anyway have effects for numerically sensitive problems.
