The ``differentiated_input_names_substitute`` argument of ``BaseFormulation``, ``BaseMDOFormulation``, ``MDF``, ``IDF``, ``BiLevel`` and ``DisciplinaryOpt``  defines the names of the differentiated inputs; if empty, the formulation will consider all the inputs. It enables derivatives to be calculated with respect to discipline inputs that are not in the design space attached to the formulation.
