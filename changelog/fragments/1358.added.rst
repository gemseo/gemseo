The ``SequenceTransformer`` class now has a ``set_bounds`` method which allows to set lower and/or upper bounds for the computed transformed iterates.
When components of the iterates fall outside of the bounds, they are projected onto the appropriate bound.
The bounds must be provided has NumPy arrays with same size as the iterates.

The ``BaseMDASolver``, ``MDAChain`` and ``MDASequential`` classes now have a ``set_bounds`` method which allows to set lower and/or upper bound for each resolved variables (coupling or state).
The bounds must be provided as a mapping from variable names to tuple of the form ``(lower_bound, upper_bound)``, where ``lower_bound`` and/or ``upper_bound`` must be NumPy arrays with the same size as the resolved variable.
