The ``VariableRenamer`` class can be used to create translators,
which are translation dictionaries
of the form ``{discipline_name: {variable_name: new_variable_name}}``
from tuples, dictionaries, CSV files and spreadsheets.
These dictionaries can then be used
to create a ``RemappingDiscipline`` or a ``NameMapping`` data processor.
