The ``samples`` option of the algorithm ``CustomDOE`` can be
a 2D-array shaped as ``(n_samples, total_variable_size)``,
a dictionary shaped as ``{variable_name: variable_samples, ...}``
where ``variable_samples`` is a 2D-array shaped as ``(n_samples, variable_size)``
or an ``n_samples``-length list shaped as ``[{variable_name: variable_sample, ...}, ...]``
where ``variable_sample`` is a 1D-array shaped as ``(variable_size, )``.
