The documentation has been updated to inform the end-user
not to use ``namespaces_separator`` (default: ``":"``) in discipline variable names,
as |g| uses this special character  to separate the original names from the namespace associated with these variables.
The end-user must never add the namespaces by hand
but always use the dedicated methods
such as ``Discipline.add_namespace_to_input``, ``Discipline.add_namespace_to_output`` and ``BaseGrammar.add_namespace``.
