BREAKING CHANGE: ``JSONGrammar`` no longer merge the definition of a property with the dictionary-like ``update`` methods.
Now the usual behavior of a dictionary will be used such that the definition of a property is overwritten.
The previous behavior can be used by passing the argument ``merge = True``.
