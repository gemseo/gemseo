``BaseAlgorithmLibrary`` and its derived classes now validate their settings (referred to as options in previous
versions of GEMSEO) using a Pydantic model. The Pydantic models replace the ``JSONGrammar`` validation used in previous
versions of GEMSEO. The aforementioned models have a hierarchical structure, for instance, the
``BaseDriverLibrarySettings`` shall inherit from ``BaseAlgorithmLibrary`` in the same way as ``BaseDriverLibrary``
inherits from ``BaseAlgorithmLibrary``.
The ``CustomDOE`` module has been renamed from ``lib_custom_doe.py`` to ``custom_doe.py``.
The ``OpenTURNS`` module has been renamed from ``lib_openturns.py`` to ``openturns.py``.
The ``PyDOE`` module has been renamed from ``lib_pydoe.py`` to ``pydoe.py``.
The ``DiagonalDOE`` module has ben renamed from ``lib_scalable.py`` to ``scalable.py``.
The ``SciPyDOE`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy.py`` to ``scipy_doe.py``.
The ``delimiter`` setting of the ``CustomDOE`` no longer accepts ``None`` as a value.
The ``ScipyODEAlgos`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy_ode.py`` to ``scipy_ode.py``.
The ``ScipyGlobalOpt`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy_global.py`` to ``scipy_global.py``.
The ``ScipyLinprog`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy_linprog.py`` to ``scipy_linprog.py``.
The following setting names for ``ScipyLinprog`` have been modified:
    - ``max_iter`` is now ``maxiter``,
    - ``verbose`` is now ``disp``,
    - ``redundancy removal`` is now ``rr``,
The ``ScipyOpt`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy.py`` to ``scipy_local.py``.
The following setting names for ``ScipyOpt`` have been modified:
    - ``max_ls_step_size`` is now ``maxls``,
    - ``max_ls_step_nb`` is now ``stepmx``,
    - ``max_fun_eval`` is now ``maxfun``,
    - ``pg_tol`` is now ``gtol``,
The ``ScipyMILP`` module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy_milp.py`` to ``scipy_local_milp.py``.
The following setting names for ``ScipyMILP`` has been modified:
    - ``max_iter`` is now ``node_limit``.
    - The SciPy linear algebra library module has been renamed from ``lib_scipy_linalg.py`` to ``scipy_linalg.py``.
- The ``DEFAULT`` linear solver from ``ScipyLinalgAlgos`` has been modified. Now it simply runs the LGMRES algorithm. Before it first attempted to solve using GMRES, the LGMRES in case of failure, then using direct method in case of failure.
- The following setting names have been modified:
    - ``max_iter`` is now ``maxiter`` (for all the scipy.linalg algorithms)
    - ``store_outer_av`` is now ``store_outer_Av`` (LGMRES)
The following setting names for ``MNBI`` have been modified:
    - ``doe_algo_options`` is now ``doe_algo_settings``,
    - ``sub_optim_algo_options`` is now ``sub_optim_algo_settings``.
