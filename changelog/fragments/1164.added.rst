Sellar problem:

- The local design variables and the coupling variables are vectors of dimension :math:`n` (default: 1), instead of scalars.
- ``Sellar2`` has a new local design variable :math:`x_2` which intervenes also in the objective expression (default: 0)
- The disciplines ``Sellar1`` and ``Sellar2`` have a coefficient :math:`k` to control the strength of the coupling (default: 1).
- The coefficient ``0.2`` in ``Sellar1`` is now an input variable named :math:`\gamma` (default: 0.2).
- The coefficient ``3.16`` in ``SellarSystem`` is now an input variable named :math:`\alpha` (default: 3.16).
- The coefficient ``24.0`` in ``SellarSystem`` is now an input variable named :math:`\beta` (default: 24.0).
