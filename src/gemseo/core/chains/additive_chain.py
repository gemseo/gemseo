            use_threading: Whether to use threads instead of processes
                to parallelize the execution;
                multiprocessing will copy (serialize) all the disciplines,
                while threading will share all the memory.
                This is important to note
                if you want to execute the same discipline multiple times,
                you shall use multiprocessing.
            n_processes: The maximum simultaneous number of threads,
                if ``use_threading`` is True, or processes otherwise,
                used to parallelize the execution.
                If ``None``, uses the number of disciplines.

        Notes:
            The actual number of processes could be lower than ``n_processes``
            if there are less than ``n_processes`` disciplines.
            ``n_processes`` can be lower than the total number of CPUs on the machine.
            Each discipline may itself run on several CPUs.
