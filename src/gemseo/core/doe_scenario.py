    """Design of Experiments scenario, based on MDO scenario but with a DOE
    driver.

    The main differences between Scenario and MDOScenario are the allowed
    inputs
    in the MDOScenario.json, which differs from DOEScenario.json, at least
    on the driver names

    MDO Problem description: links the disciplines and the formulation
    to create an optimization problem.
    Use the class by instantiation.
    Create your disciplines beforehand.

    Specify the formulation by giving the class name such as the string
    "MDF"

    The reference_input_data is the typical input data dict that is provided
    to the run method of the disciplines

    Specify the objective function name, which must be an output
    of a discipline of the scenario, with the "objective_name" attribute

    If you want to add additional design constraints,
    use the add_user_defined_constraint method

    To view the results, use the "post_process" method after execution.
    You can view:

    - the design variables history, the objective value, the constraints,
      by using: scenario.post_process("OptHistoryView", show=False, save=True)
    - Quadratic approximations of the functions close to the
      optimum, when using gradient based algorithms, by using:
      scenario.post_process("QuadApprox", method="SR1", show=False,
      save=True, function="my_objective_name",
      file_path="appl_dir")
    - Self Organizing Maps of the design space, by using:
      scenario.post_process("SOM", save=True, file_path="appl_dir")

    To list post processings on your setup,
    use the method :attr:`.Scenario.posts`.
    For more details on their options, go to the **gemseo.post** package.
