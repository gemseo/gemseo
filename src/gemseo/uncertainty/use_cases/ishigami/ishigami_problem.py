r"""A problem connecting the Ishigami function with its uncertain space.

The Isighami function
:math:`f(x_1,_2,x_3) = \sin(x_1)+ 7\sin(x_2)^2 + 0.1x_3^4\sin(X_1)`
is commonly studied through the random variable :math:`Y=f(X_1,X_2,X_3)`
where :math:`X_1`, :math:`X_2` and :math:`X_3` are independent random variables
uniformly distributed over :math:`[-\pi,\pi]`.

See :cite:`ishigami1990`.
