Estimation of statistics from a dataset
=======================================

Overview
--------

The abstract :class:`.Statistics` class implements the concept of
statistics library. It is enriched by concrete classes
such as :class:`.EmpiricalStatistics` and :class:`.ParametricStatistics`.

Construction
------------

A :class:`.Statistics` is built from a :class:`.Dataset` and optionally
a list of variables names. In this case, statistics are only computed
for these variables. Otherwise, statistics are computed for all variables.
Lastly, the user can name its :class:`.Statistics`. By default,
the name is the concatenation of the name of the class
overloading :class:`.Statistics`
and the name of the :class:`.Dataset`.

Capabilities
------------

A :class:`.Statistics` returns standard descriptive and statistical measures
for the different variables:

- :meth:`.Statistics.minimum`: the minimum value,
- :meth:`.Statistics.maximum`: the maximum value,
- :meth:`.Statistics.range`: the difference between minimum and maximum values,
- :meth:`.Statistics.mean`: the expectation, a.k.a. mean value,
- :meth:`.Statistics.moment`: the central moment which is a the expected value
  of a specified integer power of the deviation from the mean,
- :meth:`.Statistics.variance`: the variance, which is the mean squared
  variation around the mean value,
- :meth:`.Statistics.standard_deviation`: the standard deviation, which is the
  square root of the variance,
- :meth:`.Statistics.quantile`: the quantile associated with a probability,
  which is the cut point diving the range into a first continuous interval
  with this given probability and a second continuous interval
  with the complementary probability; common *q*-quantiles dividing
  the range into *q* continuous interval with equal probabilities are also
  implemented:

    - :meth:`.Statistics.median` which implements the 2-quantile (50%).
    - :meth:`.Statistics.quartile` whose order (1, 2 or 3) implements
      the 4-quantiles (respectively 25%, 50% and 75%),
    - :meth:`.Statistics.percentile` whose order (1, 2, ..., 99) implements
      the 100-quantiles (1%, 2%, ..., 99%),

- :meth:`.Statistics.probability`: the probability that the random variable
  is larger or smaller than a certain threshold,
- :meth:`.Statistics.tolerance_interval`: the left-sided, right-sided or
  both-sided tolerance interval associated with a given coverage level
  and a given confidence level, which is
  a statistical interval within which, with some confidence level,
  a specified proportion of the random variable realizations falls
  (this proportion is the coverage level)

    - :meth:`.Statistics.a_value`: the A-value, which is the lower bound of the
      left-sided tolerance interval associated with a coverage level
      equal to 99% and a confidence level equal to 95%,
    - :meth:`.Statistics.b_value`: the B-value, which is the lower bound of the
      left-sided tolerance interval associated with a coverage level equal
      to 90% and a confidence level equal to 95%,
