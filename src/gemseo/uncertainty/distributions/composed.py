r"""Joint probability distribution.

Overview
--------

:class:`.ComposedDistribution` is an abstract class
implementing the concept of `joint probability distribution
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution>`_.

The joint probability distribution of a set of random variables
is the probability distribution of the random vector
consisting of these random variables.

It takes into account
both the marginal probability distributions of these random variables
and their dependency structure.

A :class:`.ComposedDistribution` is defined
from a list of :class:`.Distribution` instances
defining the marginals of the random variables
and a copula defining the dependency structure between them.

.. note::

   A copula is a mathematical function used to define the dependence
   between random variables from their cumulative density functions.
   `See more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)>`_.

By definition, a joint probability distribution is a probability distribution
Therefore, :class:`.ComposedDistribution` inherits
from the abstract class :class:`.Distribution`.

Construction
------------

The :class:`.ComposedDistribution` of a list of given uncertain variables is built
from a list of :class:`.Distribution` objects
implementing the probability distributions of these variables
and from a copula.

Capabilities
------------

Because :class:`.ComposedDistribution` inherits from :class:`.Distribution`,
we can easily get statistics, such as :attr:`.ComposedDistribution.mean`,
:attr:`.ComposedDistribution.standard_deviation`.
We can also get the numerical :attr:`.ComposedDistribution.range` and
mathematical :attr:`.ComposedDistribution.support`.

.. note::

    We call mathematical *support* the set of values that the random variable
    can take in theory, e.g. :math:`]-\infty,+\infty[` for a Gaussian variable,
    and numerical *range* the set of values that it can take in practice,
    taking into account the values rounded to zero double precision.
    Both support and range are described in terms of lower and upper bounds

We can also evaluate the cumulative density function
(:meth:`.ComposedDistribution.compute_cdf`)
for the different marginals of the random variable,
as well as the inverse cumulative density function
(:meth:`.ComposedDistribution.compute_inverse_cdf`). We can plot them,
either for a given marginal (:meth:`.ComposedDistribution.plot`)
or for all marginals (:meth:`.ComposedDistribution.plot_all`).

Lastly, we can compute realizations of the random variable
by means of the :meth:`.ComposedDistribution.compute_samples` method.
