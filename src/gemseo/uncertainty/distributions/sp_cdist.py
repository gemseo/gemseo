"""
Composed distribution based on scipy
====================================

Overview
--------

The :class:`.SPComposedDistribution` class is a concrete class
inheriting from :class:`.ComposedDistribution` which is an abstract one.

Construction
------------

The :class:`.SPComposedDistribution` of a list of given uncertain variables
is built from a list of :class:`.SPDistribution` objects
implementing the probability distributions of these variables
based on the OpenTURNS library and from a copula name.

.. note::

   A copula is a mathematical function used to define the dependence
   between random variables from their cumulative density functions.
   `See more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)>`__.
