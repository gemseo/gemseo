"""Capabilities to create and manipulate probability distributions.

This package contains:

- an abstract class :class:`.Distribution`
  to define the concept of probability distribution,
- an abstract class :class:`.ComposedDistribution`
  to define the concept of joint probability distribution
  by composing several instances of :class:`.Distribution`,
- a factory :class:`.DistributionFactory` to create instances of :class:`.Distribution`,
- concrete classes implementing these abstracts concepts, by interfacing:

  - the OpenTURNS library:
    :class:`.OTDistribution` and :class:`.OTComposedDistribution`,
  - the Scipy library:
    :class:`.SPDistribution` and :class:`.SPComposedDistribution`.

Lastly, the class :class:`.OTDistributionFitter` offers the possibility
to fit an :class:`.OTDistribution` from data based on OpenTURNS.
