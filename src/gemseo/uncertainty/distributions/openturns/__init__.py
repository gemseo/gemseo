"""OpenTURNS-based capabilities for probability distributions.

This package interfaces capabilities
from the `OpenTURNS <http://www.openturns.org/>`_ library.

Interfaced distributions
------------------------

This package implements the abstract classes :class:`.Distribution`
and :class:`.ComposedDistribution`.

Classical distributions
-----------------------

This package also implements a deliberately limited selection
of standard probability distributions
in a user-friendly way: :class:`.OTExponentialDistribution`,
:class:`.OTNormalDistribution`, :class:`.OTTriangularDistribution`,
and :class:`.OTUniformDistribution`. More precisely,
the argument whose nature is a tuple of positional parameters
is replaced with several user-defined keyword arguments.
In this way, the use writes :code:`OTUniformDistribution('x', -1., 3.)`
or :code:`OTUniformDistribution('x', minimum=-1., maximum=3.)`
instead of :code:`OTDistribution('x', 'Uniform', (-1., 3.))`.
Furthermore, these classes inheriting from :class:`.OTDistribution`
are documented in such a way that a newbie could easily apprehend them.

Composed distribution
---------------------

A :code:`OTDistribution` has a :attr:`.OTDistribution._COMPOSED_DISTRIBUTION`
attribute referencing :class:`.OTComposedDistribution`
which is a class to build a composed distribution
related to given random variables from a list of :class:`.OTDistribution` objects
implementing the probability distributions of these variables
based on the OpenTURNS library and from a copula name.

.. note::

   A copula is a mathematical function used to define the dependence
   between random variables from their cumulative density functions.
   `See more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)>`__.

Distribution fitting
--------------------

The class :class:`.OTDistributionFitter` offers the possibility
to fit an :class:`.OTDistribution` from :code:`numpy.array` data,
based on the OpenTURNS capabilities.
