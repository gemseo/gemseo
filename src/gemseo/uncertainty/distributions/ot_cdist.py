"""
Composed distribution based on OpenTURNS
========================================

Overview
--------

The :class:`.OTComposedDistribution` class is a concrete class
inheriting from :class:`.ComposedDistribution` which is an abstract one.
OT stands for `OpenTURNS <http://www.openturns.org/>`_
which is the library it relies on.

Construction
------------

The :class:`.OTComposedDistribution` of a list of given uncertain variables
is built from a list of :class:`.OTDistribution` objects
implementing the probability distributions of these variables
based on the OpenTURNS library and from a copula name.

.. note::

   A copula is a mathematical function used to define the dependence
   between random variables from their cumulative density functions.
   `See more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)>`__.
