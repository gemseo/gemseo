    """Factory to build instances of :class:`.Distribution`.

    At initialization, this factory scans the following modules
    to search for subclasses of this class:

    - the modules located in ``gemseo.uncertainty.distributions`` and its sub-packages,
    - the modules referenced in the ``GEMSEO_PATH,``
    - the modules referenced in the ``PYTHONPATH`` and starting with ``gemseo_``.

    Then, it can check if a class is present or return the list of available classes.

    Lastly, it can create an instance of a class.

    Examples:
        >>> from gemseo.uncertainty.distributions.factory import DistributionFactory
        >>> factory = DistributionFactory()
        >>> factory.is_available("OTNormalDistribution")
        True
        >>> factory.available_distributions[-3:]
        ['SPNormalDistribution', 'SPTriangularDistribution', 'SPUniformDistribution']
        >>> distribution = factory.create("OTNormalDistribution", "x")
