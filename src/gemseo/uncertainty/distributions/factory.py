Distribution factory
====================

This module contains a factory to instantiate a :class:`.Distribution`
from its class name.
The class can be internal to |g|
or located in an external module whose path is provided to the constructor.
It also provides a list of available distributions types
and allows you to test if a distribution type is available.
