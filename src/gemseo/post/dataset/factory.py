"""A factory to create instances of :class:`.DatasetPlot`.

The module :mod:`~gemseo.post.dataset.factory` contains the :class:`.DatasetPlotFactory`
class which is a factory to instantiate a :class:`.DatasetPlot` from its class name. The
class can be internal to |g| or located in an external module whose path is provided to
the constructor. It also provides a list of available cache types and allows you to test
if a cache type is available.
