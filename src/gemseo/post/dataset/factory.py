Dataset plot factory
====================

The module :mod:`~gemseo.post.dataset.factory` contains
the :class:`DatasetPlotFactory` class which is a factory
to instantiate a :class:`.DatasetPlot` from its class name.
The class can be internal to |g| or located in an external module whose path
is provided to the constructor. It also provides a list of available cache
types and allows you to test if a cache type is available.
