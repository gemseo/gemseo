"""Datasets post-processing.

A :class:`.DatasetPlot` is a generic graphical representation of a :class:`.Dataset`
that can be displayed on screen or saved to a file.
The different visualization tools
(:class:`.OptPostProcessor`, :meth:`.SensitivityAnalysis.plot`, ...)
proposed by |g| rely more and more on it
to factorize the code,
separate data and graph generation
and standardize the visualizations.

As an example,
:class:`~gemseo.post.dataset.radar_chart.RadarChart` implements a
`radar chart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart>`__
and is used by both
:class:`~gemseo.post.radar_chart.RadarChart`
to visualize the constraints stored in a :class:`.Database`
and :meth:`.SensitivityAnalysis.plot_radar`
to visualize the sensitivity indices generated by a :class:`.SensitivityAnalysis`.
