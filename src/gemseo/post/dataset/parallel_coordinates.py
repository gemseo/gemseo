r"""Draw parallel coordinates from a :class:`.Dataset`.

The :class:`.ParallelCoordinates` class implements the parallel coordinates
plot, a.k.a. cowebplot, which is a way to visualize :math:`n` samples of a
high-dimensional vector

.. math::

   x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_d)\in\mathbb{R}^d

in a 2D referential by representing each sample

.. math::

   x^{(i)}=(x_1^{(i)},x_2^{(i)},\ldots,x_d^{(i)})

as a piece-wise line where the x-values of the nodes from left to right
are the values of :math:`x_1`, :math:`x_2`, ... and :math:`x_d^{(i)}`.

A variable name is required by the :meth:`.DatasetPlot.execute` method
by means of the :code:`classifier` keyword in order to color the curves
according to the value of the variable name. This is useful when the data is
labeled or when we are looking for the samples for which the classifier value
is comprised in some interval specified by the :code:`lower` and :code:`upper`
arguments
(default values are set to :code:`-inf` and :code:`inf` respectively).
In the latter case, the color scale is composed of only two values: one for
the samples positively classified and one for the others.
