    """Generate a gantt chart with processes execution time data.

    The disciplines names are used as labels and plotted on rows.
    The x labels are the execution start and end times of all disciplines.

    Both executions and linearizations times are plotted.

    Warning:
        ``MDODiscipline.activate_time_stamps()`` must be called first.

    Args:
        file_path: The path to save the figure.
        save: Whether to save the figure.
        show: Whether to show the figure.
        file_extension: A file extension, e.g. 'png', 'pdf', 'svg', ...
            If ``None``, use the default file extension.
        fig_size: The figure size.
        font_size: The size of the fonts in the plot.
        disc_names: The names of the disciplines to plot.
            If ``None``, plot all the disciplines for which time stamps exist.

    Returns:
        The matplotlib figure.
