Scalable model factory
======================

This module contains the :class:`.ScalableModelFactory` which is a factory
to create a :class:`.ScalableModel` from its class name by means of the
:meth:`.ScalableModelFactory.create` method. It is also possible to get a list
of available scalable models
(see :attr:`.ScalableModelFactory.scalable_models` method)
and to check is a type of scalable model is available
(see :meth:`.ScalableModelFactory.is_available` method)
