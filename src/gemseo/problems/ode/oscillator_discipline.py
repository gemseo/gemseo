r"""A harmonic oscillator.

In classical mechanics,
the position :math:`x` of a harmonic oscillator is described by the equation

.. math::

    \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\omega^2 x


with :math:`\omega \in \mathbb{R}_+^*`.
This second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE)
has an analytical solution:

.. math::

    x(t) = \lambda \sin(\omega t) + \mu \cos(\omega t)


where :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\mu` are two constants
defined by the initial conditions.

This solution can be re-written
as a two-dimensional first-order ODE:

.. math::

    \begin{cases}
    \frac{dx}{dt} = v, \\
    \frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega^2 x.
    \end{cases}

where :math:`v` represents the velocity of the oscillator.
