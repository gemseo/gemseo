Rosenbrock dataset
==================

This :class:`.Dataset` contains 100 evaluations
of the well-known Rosenbrock function:

.. math::

   f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2

This function is known for its global minimum at point (1,1),
its banana valley and the difficulty to reach its minimum.

This :class:`.Dataset` is based on a full-factorial
design of experiments.
