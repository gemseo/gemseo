"""Examples of dataset.

|g| proposes several datasets containing academic data
to illustrate its capabilities:

- :func:`.create_iris_dataset` returns a collection of iris plants,
  mainly used to benchmark clustering and classification algorithms,
- :func:`.create_rosenbrock_dataset` returns a set of evaluations of
  the `Rosenbrock function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function>`__
  over a regular grid,
  initially introduced to illustrate visualization tools dedicated to surfaces
  such as :class:`.ZvsXY`,
- :func:`.create_burgers_dataset` returns a set of solutions of
  the `Burgers' equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation>`__
  at given times,
  initially introduced to illustrate dimension reduction methods,
  e.g. :class:`.PCA` or :class:`.KLSVD`.
