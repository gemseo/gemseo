    Instances of ndarray are not HashableNdarray, meaning they cannot be added to sets,

    and therefore cannot reliably implement the __hash__() method.

    The HashableNdarray class allows a way around this limitation. It implements the
    required methods for HashableNdarray objects in terms of a array ndarray object.
    This can be either a copied instance (which is safer) or the original object (which
    requires the user to be careful enough not to modify it).
