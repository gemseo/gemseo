    r"""A vector sequence transformer for fixed-point iteration method.

    For any function :math:`G : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n`, the fixed point
    iteration method computes the sequence :math:`x_{n+1} = G(x_n)`, whih is exepcted to
    converge towards a fixed point of :math:`G`.

    A sequence transformer is a function :math:`f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow
    \mathbb{R}^n` so that the new iterate is instead computed as
    .. math::

        x_{n+1}' = f(G, x_n, \dots, x_{n-k}, G(x_n)),

    for a given :math:`k \geq 0`.

    The transformed sequence is expected to exhibit faster convergence and/or better
    numerical stability.
