    The purpose of the OAT is to quantify the elementary effect

    .. math::

       df_1 = f(X_1+dX_1,\ldots,X_d)-f(X_1,\ldots,X_d)

    The elementary effects :math:`df_1,\ldots,df_d` are computed sequentially
    from an initial point

    .. math::

       X=(X_1,\ldots,X_d)

    From these elementary effects, we can compare their absolute values
    :math:`|df_1|,\ldots,|df_d|` and sort :math:`X_1,\ldots,X_d` accordingly.

    Note that
    |g| does not implement this sensitivity analysis
    but this DOE is used by the :class:`.MorrisAnalysis`,
    which repeats this sensitivity analysis
    and computes statistics from the repetitions.
