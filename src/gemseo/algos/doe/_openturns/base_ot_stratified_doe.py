                Otherwise,
                the DOE will use the center of the unit hypercube
                and the levels and the effective number of samples
                will depend on the stratified DOE type.
            centers: The center of the DOE in the unit hypercube.
                This argument is used when ``n_samples`` is not ``None``.
                If a real number is passed,
                create a ``dimension``-length vector filled with this value.
                Otherwise, the length of ``centers`` must be equal to ``dimension``.
            levels: The relative positions of the levels
                This argument is used when ``n_samples`` is not ``None``.
