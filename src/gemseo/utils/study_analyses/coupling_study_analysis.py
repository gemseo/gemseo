    Based on an Excel file defining disciplines in terms of input and output names,
    this analysis generates an N2 (equivalent to the Design Structure Matrix) diagram,
    showing the couplings between the disciplines.

    The Excel file shall contain one sheet per discipline:

    - the name of the sheet shall have the discipline name,
    - the sheet shall define the input names of the discipline
      as a vertical succession of cells starting with ``Inputs``:

        .. table:: Inputs

            +--------------+
            | Inputs       |
            +--------------+
            | input_name_1 |
            +--------------+
            | ...          |
            +--------------+
            | input_name_N |
            +--------------+

    - the sheet shall define the output names of the discipline
      as a vertical succession of cells starting with ``Outputs``:

    .. table:: Outputs

            +---------------+
            | Outputs       |
            +---------------+
            | output_name_1 |

            +---------------+
            | output_name_N |
            +---------------+

    - the empty lines of the series ``Inputs`` and ``Outputs`` are ignored,
    - the sheet may contain other data, but these will not be taken into account.
