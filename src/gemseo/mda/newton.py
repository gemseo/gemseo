"""A set of Newton algorithm variants for solving MDAs.

Root finding methods include:

- `Newton-Raphson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method>`__
- `quasi-Newton methods <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Newton_method>`__

Each of these methods is implemented by a class in this module.
All inherit from the common abstract MDARoot.
