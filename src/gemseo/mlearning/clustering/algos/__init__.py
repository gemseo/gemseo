"""Clusterers.

This package includes clustering algorithms, a.k.a. clusterers.

Given an input data,
a clusterer is used to group data into classes, a.k.a. clusters.

Wherever possible,
these algorithms should be able to predict the class of a new data,
as well as the probability of belonging to each class.

Use the :class:`.ClustererFactory` to access all the available clusterers
or derive either the :class:`.BaseClusterer` or :class:`.BasePredictiveClusterer`  class
to add a new one.
