R2 error measure
================

The :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.qual_measure.r2_measure` module
implements the concept of R2 measures for machine learning algorithms.

This concept is implemented through the :class:`.R2Measure` class
and overloads the :meth:`!MLErrorMeasure._compute_measure` method.

The R2 is defined by

.. math::

    R_2(\\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_i (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
                              {\\sum_i (y_i-\\bar{y})^2},

where
:math:`\\hat{y}` are the predictions,
:math:`y` are the data points and
:math:`\\bar{y}` is the mean of :math:`y`.
