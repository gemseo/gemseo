Mean squared error measure
==========================

The :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.qual_measure.mse_measure` module
implements the concept of means squared error measures
for machine learning algorithms.

This concept is implemented through the
:class:`.MSEMeasure` class and
overloads the :meth:`!MLErrorMeasure._compute_measure` method.

The mean squared error (MSE) is defined by

.. math::

    \\operatorname{MSE}(\\hat{y})=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2,

where
:math:`\\hat{y}` are the predictions and
:math:`y` are the data points.
