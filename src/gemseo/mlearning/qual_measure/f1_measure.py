F1 error measure
================

The F1 is defined by

.. math::

    F_1 = 2\\frac{\\mathit{precision}\\mathit{recall}}
        {\\mathit{precision}+\\mathit{recall}}

where
:math:`\\mathit{precision}` is the number of correctly predicted positives divided by
the total number of predicted positives and
:math:`\\mathit{recall}` is the number of correctly predicted positives divided by the
total number of true positives.
