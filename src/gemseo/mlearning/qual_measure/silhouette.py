r"""The silhouette coefficient to measure the quality of a clustering algorithm.

The :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.qual_measure.silhouette` module implements the
concept of silhouette coefficient measure for machine learning algorithms.

This concept is implemented through the
:class:`.SilhouetteMeasure` class and
overloads the :meth:`!MLClusteringMeasure._compute_measure` method.

The silhouette coefficient is defined for each point as the difference
between the average distance from the point to each of the other points in its cluster
and the average distance from the point to each of the points
in the nearest cluster different from its own.

More formally,
the silhouette coefficient :math:`s_i` of a point :math:`x_i` is given by

.. math::

    a_i = \\frac{1}{|C_{k_i}| - 1} \\sum_{j\\in C_{k_i}\setminus\{i\} } \\|x_i-x_j\\|\\\\
    b_i = \\underset{\\ell=1,\\cdots,K\\atop{\\ell\\neq k_i}}{\\min}\\
        \\frac{1}{|C_\\ell|} \\sum_{j\\in C_\\ell} \\|x_i-x_j\\|\\\\
    s_i = \\frac{b_i-a_i}{\\max(b_i,a_i)}

where
:math:`k_i` is the index of the cluster to which :math:`x_i` belongs,
:math:`K` is the number of clusters,
:math:`C_k` is the set of indices of points
belonging to the cluster :math:`k` (:math:`k=1,\\cdots,K`),
and :math:`|C_k| = \\sum_{j\\in C_k} 1` is the number of points
in the cluster :math:`k`, :math:`k=1,\\cdots,K`.
