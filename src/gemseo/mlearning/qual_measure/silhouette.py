Silhouette coefficient clustering measure
=========================================

The :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.qual_measure.silhouette` module implements the
concept of silhouette coefficient measure for machine learning algorithms.

This concept is implemented through the
:class:`.SilhouetteMeasure` class and
overloads the :meth:`!MLClusteringMeasure._compute_measure` method.

The silhouette coefficient is defined for each point as the difference between
the average distance from the point to each of the other points in its cluster
and the average distance from the point to each of the points in the the
nearest cluster different from its own.

More formally, the silhouette coefficient :math:`s_i` of a point :math:`x_i`
is given by

.. math::

    a_i = \\frac{1}{|C_{k_i}|} \\sum_{j\\in\\C_{k_i}} \\|x_i-x_j\\|\\\\
    b_i = \\underset{\\ell=1,\\cdots,K\\atop{\\ell\\neq k_i}}{\\min}\\
        \\frac{1}{|C_\\ell|} \\sum_{j\\in\\C_\\ell} \\|x_i-x_j\\|\\\\
    s_i = \\frac{b_i-a_i}{\\max(b_i,a_i)}

where
:math:`K` is the number of clusters,
:math:`C_k` is the set of indices of points belonging to
cluster :math:`k\\ k=1,\\cdots,K` and
:math:`|C_k| = \\sum_{j\\in C_i} 1` is the number of points in
cluster :math:`k\\ k=1,\\cdots,K`.
