r"""The mean squared error to measure the quality of a regression algorithm.

The :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.quality_measures.mse_measure` module
implements the concept of mean squared error measures
for machine learning algorithms.

This concept is implemented through the :class:`.MSEMeasure` class
and overloads the :meth:`!MLErrorMeasure._compute_measure` method.

The mean squared error (MSE) is defined by

.. math::

    \\operatorname{MSE}(\\hat{y})=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2,

where :math:`\\hat{y}` are the predictions and :math:`y` are the data points.
