Clustering model factory
========================

This module contains a factory to instantiate a :class:`.MLClusteringAlgo`
from its class name. The class can be internal to |g| or located in an
external module whose path is provided to the constructor. It also provides a
list of available clustering models and allows you to test if a clustering
model type is available.
