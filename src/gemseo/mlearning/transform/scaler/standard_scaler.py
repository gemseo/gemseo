"""Scaling a variable with a statistical linear transformation.

The :class:`.StandardScaler` class implements the Standard scaling method
applying to some parameter :math:`z`:

.. math::

    \\bar{z} := \\text{offset} + \\text{coefficient}\\times z
    = \\frac{z-\\text{mean}(z)}{\\text{std}(z)}

where :math:`\\text{offset}=-\\text{mean}(z)/\\text{std}(z)` and
:math:`\\text{coefficient}=1/\\text{std}(z)`.

In this standard scaling method,
the scaling operation linearly transforms the original variable math:`z`
such that in the scaled space,
the original data have zero mean and unit standard deviation.
