"""Scaling a variable with a geometrical linear transformation.

The :class:`.MinMaxScaler` class implements the MinMax scaling method
applying to some parameter :math:`z`:

.. math::

    \\bar{z} := \\text{offset} + \\text{coefficient}\\times z
    = \\frac{z-\\text{min}(z)}{(\\text{max}(z)-\\text{min}(z))},

where :math:`\\text{offset}=-\\text{min}(z)/(\\text{max}(z)-\\text{min}(z))`
and :math:`\\text{coefficient}=1/(\\text{max}(z)-\\text{min}(z))`.

In the MinMax scaling method,
the scaling operation linearly transforms the original variable :math:`z`
such that the minimum of the original data corresponds to 0 and the maximum to 1.
