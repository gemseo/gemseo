r"""A Yeo-Johnson power transformation.

Transform :math:`x` as:

.. math::
   y   = & ((x + 1)^\lambda - 1) / \lambda, \text{ for } x \geq 0, \lambda \neq 0 \\\\
   & \log(x + 1), \text{ for }x \geq 0, \lambda = 0 \\\\
   & -\frac{(1-x)^{2 - \lambda} - 1}{2-\lambda}, \text{for} x < 0, \lambda \neq 2\\\\
   & -log(1-x), \text{ for } x < 0, \lambda = 2

Dependence
----------
This transformation algorithm relies on the ``PowerTransformer`` class
of `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/
stable/modules/generated/
sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html>`_.
