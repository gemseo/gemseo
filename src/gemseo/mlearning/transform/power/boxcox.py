r"""A Box-Cox power transformation.

Transform a variable :math:`x` as:

.. math::

   y    & = (x^\lambda - 1) / \lambda,  \text{for } \lambda \neq  0 \\\\
        & = \log(x), \text{for } \lambda = 0

Dependence
----------
This transformation algorithm relies on the ``PowerTransformer`` class
of `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/
stable/modules/generated/
sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html>`_.
