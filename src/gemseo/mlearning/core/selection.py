Machine learning algorithm selection
====================================

Machine learning is used to find relations or underlying structures in data.
There is however no algorithm that is universally better than the others for
an arbitrary problem (see "No free lunch theorem"). Provided a quality measure,
one can thus compare the performances of different machine learning algorithms.

This process can be easily performed using the class :class:`.MLAlgoSelection`.

A machine learning algorithm is built using a set of (hyper)parameters, before
learning takes place. In order to choose the best hyperparameters, a simple
grid search over different values may be sufficient. The
:class:`.MLAlgoSelection` does this. It can also perform a more advanced form
of optimization than a simple grid search over predefined values, using the
class :class:`.MLAlgoCalibration`.
