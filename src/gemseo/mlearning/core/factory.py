Machine learning algorithm factory
==================================

This module contains a factory to instantiate a :class:`.MLAlgo` from its class
name. The class can be internal to |g| or located in an external module whose
path is provided to the constructor. It also provides a list of available
machine learning algorithm types and allows you to test if a machine learning
algorithm type is available.
