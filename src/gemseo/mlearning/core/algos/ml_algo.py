"""This module contains the base class for machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning is the art of building models from data,
the latter being samples of properties of interest
that can sometimes be sorted by group, such as inputs, outputs, categories, ...

In the absence of such groups,
the data can be analyzed through a study of commonalities,
leading to plausible clusters.
This is referred to as clustering,
a branch of unsupervised learning
dedicated to the detection of patterns in unlabeled data.

.. seealso::

   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.core.unsupervised`,
   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.clustering.clustering`

When data can be separated into at least two categories by a human,
supervised learning can start with classification
whose purpose is to model the relations
between these categories and the properties of interest.
Once trained,
a classification model can predict the category
corresponding to new property values.

.. seealso::

   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.core.supervised`,
   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.classification.classification`

When the distinction between inputs and outputs can be made among the data properties,
another branch of supervised learning can be considered: regression modeling.
Once trained,
a regression model can predict the outputs corresponding to new inputs values.

.. seealso::

   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.core.supervised`,
   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.regression.regression`

The quality of a machine learning algorithm can be measured
using a :class:`.BaseMLAlgoQuality`
either with respect to the learning dataset
or to a test dataset or using resampling methods,
such as K-folds or leave-one-out cross-validation techniques.
The challenge is to avoid over-learning the learning data
leading to a loss of generality.
We often want to build models that are not too dataset-dependent.
For that,
we want to maximize both a learning quality and a generalization quality.
In unsupervised learning,
a quality measure can represent the robustness of clusters definition
while in supervised learning, a quality measure can be interpreted as an error,
whether it is a misclassification in the case of the classification algorithms
or a prediction one in the case of the regression algorithms.
This quality can often be improved
by building machine learning models from standardized data
in such a way that the data properties have the same order of magnitude.


.. seealso::

   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.quality_measures.quality_measure`,
   :mod:`~gemseo.mlearning.transformers.transformer`

Lastly,
a machine learning algorithm often depends on hyperparameters
to be carefully tuned in order to maximize the generalization power of the model.
