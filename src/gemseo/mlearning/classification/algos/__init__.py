"""Classifiers.

This package includes classification algorithms, a.k.a. classifiers.

Given an input data,
a classifier is used to predict
either the class associated with this input data
or the probability of belonging to each class.

Use the :class:`.ClassifierFactory` to access all the available classifiers
or derive the :class:`.BaseClassifier` class to add a new one.
