    This formulation draws an optimization architecture

    in order to obtain the solution of the MDO problem.

    At each iteration on the global design variables,
    the bi-level-BCD MDO formulation implementation performs:

    1. a first MDA to compute the coupling variables,
    2. a loop on several disciplinary optimizations on the
       local design variables using an :class:`.MDAGaussSeidel`,
    3. an MDA to compute precisely the system optimization criteria.
