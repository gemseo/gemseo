This maximizes the exploitation of the parallelism
but leads to a larger design space,
so usually more iterations by the optimizer.
Otherwise,
the coupling graph is analyzed
and the disciplines are chained in sequence and in parallel to solve all weak couplings.
In this case,
only the strong couplings are used as target variables in the design space.
This reduces the size of the optimization problem,
so usually leads to less iterations.
The best option depends on the number of strong vs weak couplings,
the availability of gradients,
the availability of CPUs versus the number of disciplines,
so it is very context dependant.
Otherwise, IDF will consider only the strong coupling targets.""",
