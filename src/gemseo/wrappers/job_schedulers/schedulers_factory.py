        """Wrap the discipline within another one to delegate its execution to a job
        scheduler.

        The discipline is serialized to the disk, its input too, then a job file is
        created from a template to execute it with the provided options.
        The submission command is launched, it will setup the environment, deserialize
        the discipline and its inputs, execute it and serialize the outputs.
        Finally, the deserialized outputs are returned by the wrapper.

        All process classes :class:`~gemseo.core.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario`,
        or :class:`~gemseo.mda.mda.MDA`, inherit from
        :class:`~gemseo.core.discipline.MDODiscipline` so can be sent to HPCs this way.

        The job scheduler template script can be provided directly or the predefined
        templates file names in gemseo.wrappers.job_schedulers.template can be used.
        SLURM and LSF templates are provided, but one can use other job schedulers
        or to customize the scheduler commands according to the user needs
        and infrastructure requirements.

        The command to submit the job can also be overloaded.

        Args:
            discipline: The discipline to wrap in the job scheduler.
            scheduler_name: The name of the job scheduler (for instance LSF, SLURM, PBS).
            workdir_path: The path to the workdir
            **options: The submission options.

        Raises:
            OSError: If the job template does not exist.

        Warning:
        This method serializes the passed discipline so it has to be serializable.
        All disciplines provided in |g| are serializable but it is possible that custom
        ones are not and this will make the submission process fail.
