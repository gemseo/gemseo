r"""Scenario adapters.

A scenario adapter is a [Discipline][gemseo.core.discipline.discipline.Discipline]
wrapping a [BaseScenario][gemseo.scenarios.base_scenario.BaseScenario].
A call to [Discipline.execute()][gemseo.core.discipline.discipline.Discipline.execute]
triggers calls
to [MDOScenario.execute][gemseo.scenarios.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario.execute].

For instance,
let us consider an [MDOScenario][gemseo.scenarios.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario]
defining a gradient-based constrained minimization of a cost function
over a [DesignSpace][gemseo.algos.design_space.DesignSpace]
from several [Discipline][gemseo.core.discipline.discipline.Discipline] instances.
If this optimization problem is not convex,
it is advisable to set up a multi-start strategy
to repeat this minimization from different starting points
in order to find a *good* local minimum.
In this case,
an
[MDOScenarioAdapter][gemseo.disciplines.scenario_adapters.mdo_scenario_adapter.MDOScenarioAdapter]
takes a design value as input,
use it as initial design value of the minimization algorithm
and outputs some variables of interest
such as the objective and constraints at the optimum.
Then,
this
[MDOScenarioAdapter][gemseo.disciplines.scenario_adapters.mdo_scenario_adapter.MDOScenarioAdapter]
can be used as any [Discipline][gemseo.core.discipline.discipline.Discipline]
in a [DOEScenario][gemseo.scenarios.doe_scenario.DOEScenario]
defining a sampling-based version of the previous problem.
In other words,
this [DOEScenario][gemseo.scenarios.doe_scenario.DOEScenario] repeats
the gradient-based optimization from several starting points
and returns the best local minimum.

The scenario adapters can also be useful for bi-level optimization.
Let us consider an optimization problem with two design variables,
namely $x_1$ and $x_2$.
The wrapped [MDOScenario][gemseo.scenarios.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario] solves
the optimization problem with respect to the design variables $x_1$
and another [MDOScenario][gemseo.scenarios.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario] considers
this
[MDOScenarioAdapter][gemseo.disciplines.scenario_adapters.mdo_scenario_adapter.MDOScenarioAdapter]
to solve the optimization problem with respect to $x_2$.
It is particularly relevant when the design variables have different natures,
e.g. $x_1$ is discrete and $x_2$ is continuous,
and that dedicated algorithms exist.
