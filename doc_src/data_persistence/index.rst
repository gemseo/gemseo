Data persistence
----------------

Many processes generate data that can be relevant for post-processing
(surrogate modelling, data analysis, visualization, ...).
Recording these data is called *data persistence*
and allows access to it at any time.

|g| offers different tools for data persistence:

- the cache stores the evaluations of a :class:`.MDODiscipline`,
- the database stores the evaluations of the :class:`.MDOFunction` instances attached to an :class:`.OptimizationProblem`,
- the dataset is a generic structure facilitating the post-processing of the data.
