Caching and recording discipline data
=====================================

Introduction
------------

There are several reasons to store the evaluations (input, output and Jacobian values) of a discipline:

- avoid evaluating a discipline at an input value for which it has already been evaluated,
- save data for post-processing purposes, e.g. visualization, statistics, machine learning, debugging, etc,
- save the current state in memory to restart a crashed sequential disciplinary process
  from the iteration preceding the unfortunate event,
- ...

Some of these reasons are all the more important as the discipline triggers a simulation which can be costly.
Caching disciplinary data helps to avoid wasting computing resources.

The basics
----------

In |g|, a :class:`.MDODiscipline` is composed of a :attr:`~.MDODiscipline.cache` to store these evaluations
expressed in terms of input, output and Jacobian data.

The caching mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the user passes an input value to the method :meth:`.MDODiscipline.execute`,
the :class:`.MDODiscipline` looks in its :attr:`~.MDODiscipline.cache`
if there is an output value associated with this input value.
If so,
it returns it to the user.
Otherwise,
it computes it, stores it in the cache and returns it to the user.

Define a tolerance for caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user can pass a tolerance below which two input arrays are considered equal:
``numpy.linalg.norm(user_array-cached_array)/(1+norm(cached_array)) <= tolerance``.
This tolerance could be useful to optimize CPU time.
It could be something like ``2 * numpy.finfo(float).eps``.

Export to another format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :attr:`~.MDODiscipline.cache` can be converted to a :class:`.Dataset` for post-processing purposes
using its method :meth:`~.AbstractCache.to_dataset`.
It can also be saved into an XML file to be read by `ggobi <http://ggobi.org/>`__
using its method :meth:`~.AbstractFullCache.to_ggobi`.

.. note::

   For the sake of performance,
   the input value of type ``Mapping[str, ndarray | int | float]`` is flatten to a NumPy array,
   hashed using the algorithm XXH64 of the `xxHash library <https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/>`__
   and the hashed value compare to the ones stored in the :attr:`~.MDODiscipline.cache`.

Set the cache policy of a discipline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data can be cached either:

- in memory:

  - the :class:`.SimpleCache` (default policy) only stores in memory
    the data associated with the last call to :meth:`.MDODiscipline.execute`,
  - the :class:`.MemoryFullCache` stores in memory
    the data associated with all the calls to :meth:`.MDODiscipline.execute`,

- on the disk:

  - the :class:`.HDF5Cache` stores in a node of an HDF file
    the data associated with all the calls to :meth:`.MDODiscipline.execute`.

The cache strategy of a :class:`.MDODiscipline` can be changed with the method :meth:`.MDODiscipline.set_cache_policy`
by passing as first argument the name of the cache class, e.g. ``"MemoryFullCache"``.

.. note::

    The types of cache can be extended by subclassing :class:`.AbstractFullCache` or :class:`.MemoryFullCache`.
    :meth:`~.MDODiscipline.set_cache_policy` will find the new types automatically
    because it is based on a :class:`.CacheFactory`.

Advanced use
------------

Get metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily get:

- the number of entries: ``n_entries = len(cache)``,
- the names of the input variables: ``input_names = cache.input_names``,
- the names of the output variables: ``output_names = cache.output_names``,
- the size of the variables: ``size = cache.names_to_sizes[variable_name]``.

Get the last entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``last_entry = cache.last_entry`` to retrieve the last cached data.

``last_entry`` is a :class:`.CacheEntry` with fields ``"inputs``", ``"outputs"`` and ``"jacobian"``,
to be used as ``output_value = cache_entry.outputs``.

Clear the cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``cache.clear()`` to remove all the entries.

Handle the cache as a dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A cache can be handled as a dictionary:

- store an output value: ``cache[input_value] = (output_value, None)``
- store a Jacobian value: ``cache[input_value] = (None, jacobian_value)``
- store both Jacobian and output values: ``cache[input_value] = (output_value, jacobian_value)``
- retrieve an entry: ``cache_entry = cache[input_value]``.

Cache data in an HDF file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`HDF5  <https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support>`_ is a standard file format for storing simulation data.
The following description is proposed by the `HDF5 website <https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support>`_:

    *"HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format."*

The `HDFView application <https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDFVIEW/HDFView>`_ can be used
to explore the data of the cache.
