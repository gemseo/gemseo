Overview
========

|g| stands for Generic Engine for Multi-disciplinary Scenarios, Exploration and Optimization.

Built on top of `NumPy  <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy  <http://scipy.org/>`_ and `Matplotlib  <http://www.matplotlib.org/>`_ libraries,
this `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ library enables an automatic treatment of design problems,
using design of experiments, optimization algorithms and graphic post-processing.

|g| is more particularly specialized in `Multidisciplinary Design Optimization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_design_optimization>`_ (:term:`MDO`).

What is |g| used for?
---------------------

Let us consider a design problem to be solved
over a particular design space
and using different :term:`simulation software` (called :term:`disciplines <discipline>`).

From this information, |g| carries out the following steps:

   #. **Create** a :term:`scenario`, translating this design problem into a mathematical :term:`optimization problem`.
      The user can choose its favorite :ref:`MDO formulation <mdo_formulations>` (or architecture) or test another one,
      by simply giving the name of the formulation to the scenario.
      :ref:`Bi-level MDO formulations <bilevel_formulation>` allow to use disciplines that are themselves scenarios.

   #. **Solve** this design problem, using either an :term:`optimization algorithm` or a :term:`DOE`.

   #. **Plot** the results and logs of the optimization problem resolution.

The power of |g|
----------------

Fully based on the power of object-oriented programming,
the :term:`scenario` automatically generates the :term:`process`,
with corresponding :term:`work flow` and :term:`data flow`.

|g| aims at pushing forward the limits of automation in simulation processes development,
with a particular focus made on:

   - the integration of heterogeneous simulation environments in industrial and research contexts,
   - the integration of state of the art algorithms for optimization, design of experiments, and coupled analyses,
   - the automation of :term:`MDO` results analysis,
   - the development of distributed and multi-level :ref:`MDO formulations <mdo_formulations>`.
