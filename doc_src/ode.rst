Ordinary Differential Equations
-------------------------------

An :class:`.ODEProblem` represents an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a given
state at an initial time.
This :class:`.ODEProblem` is built with a function of time and state, as well as an array
describing the intial state.

.. note::

    This feature is under active development. Future iterations include the integration of
    :class:`.ODEProblem` s with :class:`.MDODiscipline`.
