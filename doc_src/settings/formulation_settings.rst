Formulation Settings
====================

The available |g| formulations require different configuration settings to be instantiated. There are two ways to pass
formulation settings, either one by one:

.. code-block:: python

    scenario = create_scenario(
        disciplines,
        "y_4",
        design_space,
        maximize_objective=True,
        **formulation_settings,
        formulation_name="MDF",
        main_mda_name="MDAGaussSeidel",
        main_mda_settings={
            "max_mda_iter": 50,
            "warm_start": True,
            "linear_solver_tolerance": 1e-14,
        },
    )

or via their associated Pydantic model:

.. code-block:: python

    from gemseo.settings.formulations import MDF_Settings

    scenario = create_scenario(
        disciplines,
        "y_4",
        design_space,
        maximize_objective=True,
        formulation_settings_model=MDF_Settings(
            main_mda_name="MDAGaussSeidel",
            main_mda_settings={
                "max_mda_iter": 50,
                "warm_start": True,
                "linear_solver_tolerance": 1e-14,
            },
        ),
    )

The advantage of using the Pydantic model directly is that IDEs provide auto completion for Pydantic models. Another
advantage is that the settings are validated at instantiation of the Pydantic model, so in case a setting name or
setting value is not valid, the validation exception will happen before the execution of the scenario, thus saving time.
