Dependencies
------------

|g| depends on the packages listed below,
some of them are optional.

You may use more recent versions of these packages,
but we cannot guarantee the backward compatibility.
However,
we provide a large set of tests with a high code
coverage so that you can fully check your configuration.

.. seealso::

   Fully check your configuration with :ref:`test_gemseo`.

Core features
*************

The required dependencies provide the core features of |g|,
these are:

    - docstring-inheritance ==1.0.0
    - fastjsonschema >=2.14.5,<=2.16.2
    - genson ==1.2.2

Full features
*************

Some packages are not required to execute basic scenarios,
but provide additional features,
they are listed below.
The dependencies are independent,
and can be installed one by one to activate
the dependent features of listed in the same table.
Installing all those dependencies will provide the
full features set of |g|.
