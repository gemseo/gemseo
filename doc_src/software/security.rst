Security information
====================

Static Application Security Testing
-----------------------------------

We use the ``gitlab.com`` integrated
`SAST analyzers <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html>`_
to scan for vulnerabilities in |g| source code.

Dependency scanning
-------------------

Our ``gitlab.com`` projects are mirrored on ``github.com`` and
scanned there for dependency vulnerabilities by
`Dependabot <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts>`_.
