3.0.0
=====

As *GEMS* has been renamed to |g|,
upgrading from version 2 to version 3
requires to change all the import statements of your code from

.. code-block:: python

  import gems
  from gems.x.y import z

to

.. code-block:: python

  import gemseo
  from gemseo.x.y import z

2.0.0
=====

The API of *GEMS* 2 has been slightly modified
with respect to *GEMS* 1.
In particular,
for all the supported Python versions,
the strings shall to be encoded in unicode
while they were previously encoded in ASCII.

That kind of error:

.. code-block:: console

  ERROR - 17:11:09 : Invalid data in : MDOScenario_input
  ', error : data.algo must be string
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "plot_mdo_scenario.py", line 85, in <module>
      scenario.execute({"algo": "L-BFGS-B", "max_iter": 100})
    File "/home/distracted_user/workspace/gemseo/src/gemseo/core/discipline.py", line 586, in execute
      self.check_input_data(input_data)
    File "/home/distracted_user/workspace/gemseo/src/gemseo/core/discipline.py", line 1243, in check_input_data
      raise InvalidDataException("Invalid input data for: " + self.name)
  gemseo.core.grammar.InvalidDataException: Invalid input data for: MDOScenario

is most likely due to the fact
that you have not migrated your code
to be compliant with |g| 2.
To migrate your code,
add the following import at the beginning
of all your modules defining literal strings:

.. code-block:: python

   from __future__ import unicode_literals

Please also read carefully :ref:`python2and3` for more information.
