Multi Disciplinary Analyses
===========================

This section deals with the construction and execution of a Multi Disciplinary Analysis,
abbreviated MDA. MDAs are required when dealing with coupled disciplines, that is when
inputs of disciplines are outputs of others. Such variables are referred to as the
:term:`coupling variables`.

.. note::

    In |g|, the MDA objects all inherit from :class:`.BaseMDA`.


For a given set of coupled disciplines, the MDA solves for the coupling variables.
Mathematically, it reduces to the solution of a non-linear system of equations by block
of the form :math:`R(x, y^{\star}) = 0` where :math:`y^{\star}` represents the solution
for the :term:`coupling variables` and :math:`x` the remaining variables.
These latter variables *parametrize* the system of equations, i.e. for a fixed :math:`x`,
the MDA computes :math:`y^{\star}` such that :math:`R(x, y^{\star}) = 0`.


There are two main categories of MDA objects in |g|:

- The ones implementating a non-linear solver (inheriting from :class:`.BaseMDASolver`),

- The composed MDA, that creates and/or uses inner MDA solvers (more information below).

The following sub-sections present an overview of these two kinds of available MDAs.

.. seealso::

   The examples about MDA algorithms can be found `here <../examples/mda/index.html>`__

Non-linear solver algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The available non-linear solvers available in |g| can be split in two categories:

- :term:`fixed-point` methods, that compute fixed points of a coupling function :math:`F`,
    that is they solve equations of the form :math:`F(y) = y`. The available
    fixed-point methods available in |g| are the
    `Jacobi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method>`__ and
    `Gauss-Seidel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method>`__.
    methods.
- :term:`root finding` methods that solves non-linear systems of equations of the form
    :math:`R(y) = 0`. The root finding algorithms available in |g| are the
    `Newton-Raphson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method>`__ method
    which uses the (possibly partial) derivatives :math:`\partial R(y) / \partial y`,
    and several derivative-free variants known as
    `quasi-Newton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi%E2%80%93Newton_method>`__ methods.

.. note::

    A fixed-point problem can be reformulated as a root finding problem and reciprocally,
    since :math:`R(y) = 0 \iff R(y) + y = y \iff F(y) = y` with :math:`F(y) = R(y) + y`.

To create an MDA, use the :func:`.create_mda` API function, specifying the name of the
MDA class and the (coupled) disciplines.

.. code:: python

    from gemseo import create_mda, create_discipline
    from gemseo.mda.quasi_newton_settings import QuasiNewtonMethod

    # Instantiate the coupled Sellar disciplines
    disciplines = create_discipline(["Sellar1", "Sellar2"])

    # Create an MDA based on fixed-point methods
    mda_jacobi = create_mda("MDAJacobi", disciplines)
    mda_gauss_seidel = create_mda("MDAGaussSeidel", disciplines)

    # Create an MDA based on root finding methods
    mda_newton = create_mda("MDANewtonRaphson", disciplines)
    mda_quasi_newton = create_mda(
        "MDAQuasiNewton",
        disciplines,
        method=QuasiNewtonMethod.BROYDEN1,
    )

.. warning::

    Any :class:`.Discipline` provided to a :class:`.BaseMDA` with strong couplings
    **must** define its :attr:`.Discipline.default_input_data`. Otherwise, the execution
    will fail.


Composed MDA methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two composed MDAs available in |g| are the :class:`.MDASequential` and the
:class:`.MDAChain`.


The sequential MDA
""""""""""""""""""

The :class:`.MDASequential` implements a generic mechanism to execute sequentially an
arbitrary number of inner MDAs. An example is given in the following code:

.. code::

    mda_1 = create_mda("MDAJacobi", disciplines, max_mda_iter=2)
    mda_2 = create_mda("MDANewtonRaphson", disciplines)
    mda_sequential = create_mda("MDASequential", disciplines, mda_sequence=[mda1, mda2])

In this example, the sequential MDA will perform 2 iterations of the Jacobi's method,
before switching to the Newton-Raphson's method. This approach is interesting since the
Newton-Raphson's is more expensive, but converges quickly close to the solution. This
kind of sequences typically takes advantage of the robustness of fixed-point methods
while obtaining an accurate solution thanks to a Newton-Raphson's method.

.. note::

    A specific instance of sequential MDA, namely the :class:`.MDAGSNewton` is readily
    available in |g|. It starts with the Gauss-Seidel's method before switching to the
    Newton-Raphson's method.


The MDA chain
"""""""""""""

The :class:`.MDAChain` implements an advanced graph-based algorithm which allows, when
possible, to split the solution of the non-linear system of equations into smaller and
weakly coupled ones. The next figure illustrates this process on a 16 coupled
disciplines toy problem.

.. figure:: /_images/mda/mda_auto_procedure.png
    :scale: 50 %

    The 3 resolution phases of a 16 disciplines coupling problem.

The MDA chain inspects the coupling graph and **automatically** detects strongly coupled
disciplines. In the example above, the problem is split into 4 sub-systems, for which
an inner MDA implementing a non-linear solver is used. As an example, the following code
will create an MDA chain, that will solve the sub-systems using Jacobi's method. The
solver for the sub-systems is specified via the ``inner_mda_name`` setting.

.. code::

    mda = create_mda("MDAChain", disciplines, inner_mda_name="MDAJacobi")

Execution of MDAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MDA inherits from :class:`.Discipline` and can thus be executed and linearized as
any other discipline. As mentioned in the previous section, the MDA solves the
non-linear system of equations induced by coupled disciplines. Formally, it can be
viewed as a function :math:`\text{MDA}(x, y) = y^{\star}` that takes :math:`x` and
possibly initial values for the coupling variables :math:`y` and computes
:math:`y^{\star}` that satisfies :math:`R(x, y^{\star}) = 0`.

Let us take again the `Sellar's problem <../problems/sellar_description.html>`__ as a
toy example, where:

-  The design variables are labelled :math:`x_{\text{local}}` and
   :math:`x_{\text{shared}}`.

-  The coupling variables are labelled :math:`y_1` and :math:`y_2`.

The following code executes the Jacobi's algorithm on the :class:`.Sellar1` and
:class:`.Sellar2` disciplines for specific values of the design variables.

.. code:: python

    from numpy import array

    # Instantiate the coupled Sellar disciplines
    disciplines = create_discipline(["Sellar1", "Sellar2"])

    # Create an MDA based on the Jacobi's fixed-point methods
    mda_jacobi = create_mda("MDAJacobi", disciplines)

    # Execute the MDA for specific design variables
    mda_jacobi.execute({"x_local": array([0.5]), "x_shared": array([0.25, 0.25])})
    print(
        "Jacobi's method reached termination criterion "
        f"after {mda_jacobi._current_iter} iterations: "
        f"normalized residual norm = {mda_jacobi.normed_residual}"
    )


Stopping criteria
"""""""""""""""""

The MDA solvers convergence can be monitored by two criteria:
-  The maximum number of iterations,
-  The tolerance on the normalized residual norm.

These settings can be either specified at MDA creation or updated on the MDA object
directly. Here is an example of the Jacobi's method where the tolerance and the maximum
number of iterations are provided:

.. code:: python

    from gemseo.settings.mda import MDAJacobi_Settings

    # Create the settings model
    settings = MDAJacobi_Settings(tolerance=1e-6, max_mda_iter=10)

    # Create an MDA with specific stopping criteria settings
    mda_jacobi = create_mda("MDAJacobi", disciplines, settings_model=settings)

    # Execute the MDA with default input data
    mda_jacobi.execute()
    print(
        "Jacobi's method reached termination criterion "
        f"after {mda_jacobi._current_iter} iterations: "
        f"normalized residual norm = {mda_jacobi.normed_residual}"
    )

.. note::
    The tolerance is monitored on a relative decrease on the residual norm. Several
    scaling strategies for the residual are available in |g|. More information
    `here <../modules/gemseo.mda.base_mda.html#gemseo.mda.base_mda.BaseMDA.ResidualScaling>`__


Acceleration/relaxation methods
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Acceleration and relaxation methods are available for all the MDAs in |g|. The
acceleration methods available can be found
`here <../modules/gemseo.algos.sequence_transformer.acceleration.html#submodules>`__.
For instance the following code applies Gauss-Seidel's method with the :class:`Secant`
acceleration method and an over-relaxation factor of 0.95.

.. code:: python

    from gemseo.settings.mda import MDAGaussSeidel_Settings
    from gemseo.algos.sequence_transformer.acceleration import AccelerationMethod

    # Create the settings model
    settings = MDAGaussSeidel_Settings(
        acceleration_method=AccelerationMethod.SECANT,
        over_relaxation_factor=0.95,
    )

    # Create an MDA with a specific acceleration method and relaxation factor
    mda_gauss_seidel = create_mda("MDAGaussSeidel", disciplines, settings_model=settings)

    # Execute the MDA with default input data
    mda_gauss_seidel.execute()
    print(
        "Gauss-Seidel's method reached termination criterion "
        f"after {mda_gauss_seidel._current_iter} iterations: "
        f"normalized residual norm = {mda_gauss_seidel.normed_residual}"
    )


Monitor the convergence
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The convergence history of the MDA solvers can be accessed via the
:attr:`BaseMDA.residual_history` attribute. More conveniently, there is a dedicated
method as in the following example:

.. code:: python

    mda_gauss_seidel = create_mda("MDAGaussSeidel", disciplines)

    mda_gauss_seidel.execute()
    mda_gauss_seidel.plot_residual_history(show=True, save=False)


Advanced features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition with the standard MDA functionnalities, |g| provides more advanced features
that can improve performances in certain situations.

Parallelization
"""""""""""""""

The following MDA algorithms can be parallelized:

-  :class:`MDAJacobi`,

-  :class:`MDAQuasiNewton`,

-  :class:`MDANewtonRaphson`,

-  :class:`MDAChain`.

When using parallelization, it is possible to set the number of processes/threads on
which the execution will be splitted, and whether to use threads or processes. By
default, |g| uses threads and the number of threads is the number of CPUs available on
the computer the code is run on. The following code shows an example of settings related
to this feature:

.. code:: python

    # Create the settings model
    settings = MDAJacobi_Settings(use_threading=False, n_processes=4)

    # Create MDA with specific parallelization settings
    mda_jacobi = create_mda("MDAJacobi", disciplines, settings_model=settings)


Re-use coupling structures
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

MDAs are created from a set of coupled disciplines. To determine the coupling variables,
a :class:`CouplingStructure` object is created which uses graph algorithms to analyse
the coupling strcture of the provided disciplines. This process is made once at creation
of the MDA, and **only depends on the set of disciplines**. The graph analysis can be
expensive if there is a large number of disciplines and/or plenty of inputs/outputs
variables.

Since the coupling structure only depends on the coupled disciplines, it can be
computed independently, stored, and then provided to the MDA when needed.

.. code:: python

    from gemseo.core.coupling_structure import CouplingStructure

    # Create the coupling structure on the disciplines
    coupling_structure = CouplingStructure(disciplines)

    # Create the settings model
    settings = MDAGaussSeidel_Settings(coupling_structure=coupling_structure)

    # Create an MDA using the already available coupling structure
    mda_gauss_seidel = create_mda("MDAGaussSeidel", disciplines, settings_model=settings)
