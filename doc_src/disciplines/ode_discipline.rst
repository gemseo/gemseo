ODE disciplines
===============

The typical workflow is to define a list of :class:`.ODEDiscipline` s from a list of :class:`.ODEProblem` s, then execute the list of disciplines like any other.

In this tutorial, we explain this procedure in detail.


What is an ODE discipline?
--------------------------

ODE stands for Ordinary Differential Equation.

An ODE discipline is a discipline that is defined using the solution of an ODE for .

Two formulations are possible for a time-dependent optimization problem.

How to build an ODE discipline?
-------------------------------


In practice, an :class:`.ODEDiscipline` is defined from an :class:`.Discipline` and an :class:`.ODEProblem`.

Note: By default, the name of the first-order derivative of a variable is the name of that variable to which "_dot" is appended.
