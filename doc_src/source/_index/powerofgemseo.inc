Fully based on the power of object-oriented programming, the :term:`scenario` automatically generates the :term:`process`, with corresponding :term:`work flow` and :term:`data flow`.

**|g|** aims at pushing forward the limits of automation in simulation processes development, with a particular focus made on:

	- the integration of heterogeneous simulation environments in industrial and research contexts
	- the integration of state of the art algorithms for optimization, design of experiments, and coupled analyses
	- the automation of :term:`MDO` results analysis
	- the development of distributed and multi-level :ref:`MDO formulations <mdo_formulations>`
