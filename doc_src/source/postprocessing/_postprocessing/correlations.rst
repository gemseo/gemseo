Preliminaries: instantiation and execution of the MDO scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start with the following code lines which instantiate and execute the :class:`~gemseo.core.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario` :

.. code::

   from gemseo.api import create_discipline, create_scenario

   formulation = 'MDF'

   disciplines = create_discipline(["SobieskiPropulsion", "SobieskiAerodynamics",
                                    "SobieskiMission", "SobieskiStructure"])

   scenario = create_scenario(disciplines,
                              formulation=formulation,
                              objective_name="y_4",
                              maximize_objective=True,
                              design_space="design_space.txt")

   scenario.set_differentiation_method("user")

   algo_options = {'max_iter': 10, 'algo': "SLSQP"}
   for constraint in ["g_1","g_2","g_3"]:
       scenario.add_constraint(constraint, 'ineq')

   scenario.execute(algo_options)

Correlations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
-----------

A correlation coefficient indicates whether there is a linear
relationship between 2 quantities :math:`x` and :math:`y`, in which case
it equals 1 or -1. It is the normalized covariance between the two
quantities:

.. math::

   R_{xy}=\frac {\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})(y_i-{\bar{y}})}{ns_{x}s_{y}}=
   \frac {\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})(y_i-{\bar{y}})}{\sqrt {\sum
   \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})^{2}\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(y_i-{\bar{y}})^{2}}}

The **Correlations** post processing builds scatter plots of correlated variables among
design variables, output functions, and constraints.

The plot method considers all variable correlations greater than 95%. A different
threshold value and/or a sublist of variable names can be passed as options. The x-
and y-figure sizes can also be modified in options. It is possible to either save
the plot, to show the plot or both.

Options
-------

- **func_names**, :code:`list(str)` - The func_names for which the correlations are computed. If None, all functions are considered.
- **coeff_limit**, :code:`float` - If the correlation between the variables is lower than coeff_limit, the plot is not made.
- **n_plots_x**, :code:`int` - The number of horizontal plots.
- **n_plots_y**, :code:`int` - The number of vertical plots.
- **save**, :code:`bool` - If True, export the plot to file.
- **show**, :code:`bool` - If True, display the plot windows.
- **file_path**, :code:`str` - The base paths of the files to export. If None, use the current working directory.
- **extension**, :code:`str` - The file extension.
- **figsize_x**, :code:`int` - The size of the figure in the horizontal direction (inches).
- **figsize_y**, :code:`int` - The size of figure in the vertical direction (inches).

Case of the MDF formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compute the correlations between all inputs and all outputs as well
as between two outputs, use the API method :meth:`~gemseo.api.execute_post`
with the keyword :code:`"Correlations"` and
additional arguments concerning the type of display (file, screen, both):

.. code::

    scenario.post_process("Correlations", coeff_limit=0.85, save=True,
    show=False, n_plots_x=4, n_plots_y=4)

where:

-  ``coeff_limit`` is the absolute threshold for correlation plots. It
   filters the minimum correlation coefficient to be displayed,

-  ``n_plot_x`` and ``n_plot_y`` are the numbers of plots along the
   columns and the rows, respectively.

   Correlation coefficients on the Sobieski use case for the MDF
   formulation

As mentioned earlier, correlation plots highlight the strong correlations between stress
constraints in wing sections : the correlation coefficients belong to
:math:`[0.94766, 0.999286]`.

The aerodynamics constraint ``g_2`` is a polynomial function of
:math:`x_1`: :math:`g\_2=1+0.2\overline{x_1}` with
:math:`\overline{x_1}` the normalized value of :math:`x_1`.
