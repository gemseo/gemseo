Surrogate models
----------------

When an :class:`.MDODiscipline` is costly to evaluate, it can be replaced by
a :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` cheap to evaluate, e.g. linear model, Kriging,
RBF regressor, ...
This :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` is built from a few evaluations of this
:class:`.MDODiscipline`. This learning phase commonly relies on a regression
model calibrated by machine learning techniques. This is the reason why
|g| provides a machine learning package which includes the
:class:`.MLRegressionAlgo` class implementing the concept of regression model.
In addition, this machine learning package has a much broader set of features
than regression: clustering, classification, dimension reduction, data scaling, ...
