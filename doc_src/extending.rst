Extend |g| features
-------------------

The simplest way is to create a subclass
associated to the feature you want to extend,
respectively:

 - for optimizers,
   inherit from :class:`.OptimizationLibrary`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/algos/opt` package,
 - for DOEs,
   inherit from :class:`.DOELibrary`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/algos/doe` package,
 - for surrogate models,
   inherit from :class:`.MLRegressionAlgo`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/mlearning/regression` package,
 - for MDAs, inherit from :class:`.MDA`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/mda` package,
 - for MDO formulations,
   inherit from :class:`.MDOFormulation`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/formulations` package,
 - for disciplines,
   inherit from :class:`.MDODiscipline`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/problems/my_problem` package,
   which you created.
 - for job schedulers and HPC submission,
   inherit from :class:`.JobSchedulerDisciplineWrapper`,
   and put the Python file in the :file:`src/gemseo/wrappers/job_schedulers` package,
   which you created.

|g| features can be extended with external Python modules.
All kinds of additional features can be implemented:
disciplines, algorithms, formulations, post-processings, surrogate models, ...
There are 2 ways to extend |g| with Python modules:

- by creating a pip installable package with a setuptools entry point,
  see :class:`.Factory` for more details,
- by setting the environment variable :envvar:`GEMSEO_PATH`
  with the path to the directory
  that contains the Python modules,
  multiple directories can be separated by :envvar:`:`.
