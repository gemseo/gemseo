Study analysis
==============

Objective and scope
-------------------

This section describes how to use :class:`.StudyAnalysis`.
The idea is to help the users to define the right MDO problem to be solved, even before wrapping any software.
The result of the study are a :term:`N2` (or :term:`DSM`)
and :term:`XDSM` diagrams (see more explanations here :ref:`XDSM <xdsm>`),
with a defined MDO problems including:

- The list of disciplines, with their inputs and outputs
- The design variables
- The constraints
- The objective function(s)

No executable code is produced, the idea is to assist the discussions with design and field experts,
customers, to define the MDO problem, from the white sheet. This way, the study may be visualized before
any process or tool being actually ready.

There is no need to write any line of code to use this tool. A command line executable is available.

Examples
--------

The next figure illustrates how this tool can be used to create an MDO study analysis.
This requires the creation of an excel workbook with one sheet per discipline.
The name of the discipline is given by the name of the sheet.
On each of these sheets, the inputs and outputs of the discipline must be given.

   Disciplines definition

Scenarios are defined by sheet names starting with "Scenario".

The N2 and XDSM diagrams can be generated from such as study file.
The N2 diagrams are generated as pdf files.
The XDSM diagrams are generated as standalone HTML files, by default, or as Latex and pdf files as an option (-l).

For more complex use cases, multi-level formulations can also be used.
You first need to define the sub-scenarios in dedicated sheets,
and then add the names of these sheets in the cell block "Disciplines" of the sheet defining the main scenario.
Finally, a multilevel MDO formulation has to be chosen, e.g. ``"BiLevel"``.

Usage of the command line executable
------------------------------------

|g| installation provides the :program:`gemseo-study` command line executable.
This tool allows the generation of an N2 chart and an XDSM diagram from an Excel description file.

Its usage is:

``gemseo-study [-h] [-o OUT_DIR] [-x] [-p] [-s FIG_SIZE] study_file``

with

positional arguments:
  study_file            XLS file that describes the study

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUT_DIR, --out_dir OUT_DIR
                        The path of the directory to save the files.
  -x, --xdsm            Whether to generate a XDSM.
  -p, --save_pdf    Whether to save the XDSM as a PDF file.
  -s FIG_SIZE, --fig_size FIG_SIZE
                        The size of the N2 figure, as a tuple (x,y).
