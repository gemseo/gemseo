# This tutorial describes how to use the :class:`.ODEDiscipline` with coupled ODEs.
#
# Problem description
# -------------------
#
# Consider a set of point masses with masses :math:`m_1,\ m_2,...\ m_n` connected by
# springs with stiffnesses :math:`k_1,\ k_2,...\ k_{n+1}`. The springs at each end of the
# system are connected to fixed points. We hereby study the response of the system to the
# displacement of one of the point masses.
#
# .. figure:: /_images/ode/springs.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Illustration of the springs-masses problem.
#
# The motion of each point mass in this system is described
# by the following set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
#
# .. math::
#
#    \left\{ \begin{cases}
#        \frac{dx_i}{dt} &= v_i \\
#        \frac{dv_i}{dt} &=
#            - \frac{k_i + k_{i+1}}{m_i}x_i
#            + \frac{k_i}{m_i}x_{i-1} + \frac{k_{i+1}}{m_i}x_{i+1}
#    \end{cases} \right.
#
# where :math:`x_i` is the position of the :math:`i`-th point mass
# and :math:`v_i` is its velocity.
#
# These equations are coupled, since the forces applied to any given mass depend on the
# positions of its neighbors. In this tutorial, we will use the framework of the
# :class:`.ODEDisciplines` to solve this set of coupled equations.
#
