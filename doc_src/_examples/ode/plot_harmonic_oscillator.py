# This tutorial describes how to instantiate an ODEDiscipline to solve a
# first-order ordinary differential equation.
# A first-order ODE is a differential equation that can be written as
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{ds(t)}{dt} = f(t, s(t))
#
# where the right-hand side of the equation :math:`f(t, s(t))` is a function of
# time :math:`t` and of a state :math:`s(t)` that returns another state
# :math:`\frac{ds(t)}{dt}` (see Hartman, Philip (2002) [1964],
# Ordinary differential equations, Classics in Applied Mathematics, vol. 38,
# Philadelphia: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics). To solve this
# equation, initial conditions must be set:
#
# .. math::
#
#     s(t_0) = s_0
#
# For this example, we consider the harmonic oscillator equation as an example of a
# time-independent problem.
#
# Solving the harmonic oscillator problem
# ---------------------------------------
#
# The harmonic problem describes the position over time of a body oscillating with a
# frequency :math:`\omega/ (2 \pi)` according to the following ODE:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x(t) = 0
#
# where :math:`x(t)` is the position coordinate at time :math:`t`.
#
# To solve the harmonic oscillator problem with |g|,
# we start by modeling this second-order equation as a first-order equation.
# Let us define :math:`y = \frac{dx}{dt}` and the state vector :math:`s` as
# :math:`s = \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}`.
# Then the harmonic oscillator problem can be rewritten as:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{ds(t)}{dt} = f(t, s(t))
#     = \begin{pmatrix} y(t) \\ - \omega^2 x(t) \end{pmatrix}
#
#
#
# The analytical solution of the harmonic oscillator problem characterized by an angular
# velocity :math:`\omega`, and with initial position and velocity :math:`x_0` and
# :math:`v_0` respectively, at the initial time :math:`t = 0` is:
#
# .. math::
#
#     x(t) = x_0 \cos(\omega t) + (v_0 / \omega) \sin(\omega t)

# %%
# Step 1 : Definition of the dynamic
# ..................................

# As the first step, we introduce a discipline defining the dynamics of the problem,
# that is a discipline representing the right-hand side of the ODE.
# For a harmonic oscillator, the discipline can be an :class:`.AutoPyDiscipline`.
#
# The discipline describing the RHS must include, among its inputs, the time variable
# and the variables defining the state (in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the
# variables `position` and `velocity`). The outputs of the discipline must be the
# time derivatives of the state variables (here `position_dot` and `velocity_dot`).
# All inputs that are neither the time variable nor the state variables, are denoted as
# design variables.

_time = array([0.0])
position_1 = array([1.0])
velocity_1 = array([0.0])
omega_1 = array([2.0])


def rhs_function(
    time: ndarray = _time,
    position: ndarray = position_1,
    velocity: ndarray = velocity_1,
    omega: ndarray = omega_1,
):
    position_dot = velocity
    velocity_dot = -(omega**2) * position

    return position_dot, velocity_dot  # noqa: RET504


rhs_discipline = create_discipline(
    "AutoPyDiscipline",
    py_func=rhs_function,
    grammar_type=Discipline.GrammarType.SIMPLE,
)

# %%
# Step 2: Initialization of the ODEDiscipline
# ...........................................
#
# Once the discipline representing the right-hand side of the ODE has been created,
# we can create an instance of :class:`.ODEDiscipline`, representing the initial-value
# problem to be solved.
#
# The constructor of the :class:`.ODEDiscipline` must be provided with the arguments
# `discipline` (the discipline representing the RHS of the ODE), and `times` (an
# :type:`ArrayLike` with at least two entries: the fist representing the initial time,
# and the last one the final time).
# The parameter `state_names` is a list of the name of the state variables in
# `rhs_discipline`, in order  to differentiate them from the time variable (named
# `"time"` by default), and from the design variables (here `omega`).
# By default, the output of the `ODEDiscipline` are: the final time of the evaluation
# of the ODE (`"termination_time"`), the list of times for which the ODE has been
# solved (`"times"`), and the final states of the state  variables (named by default
# `"X_final"`, where `"X"` is the name of the corresponding  state variable).
# If the boolean `return_trajectories` is set to `True`, additional outputs is
# provided, consisting in the trajectories of the state variables in the times listed
# in the output `"times"`.

ode_discipline = ODEDiscipline(
    discipline=rhs_discipline,
    times=linspace(0.0, 10.0, 51),
    state_names=["position", "velocity"],
    return_trajectories=True,
)

# %%
# Step 3: Execution of the ODEDiscipline
# ......................................
#
# Once the :class:`.ODEDiscipline` has been initialized, it can be executed like all
# other disciplines in |g| by the method `execute()`.

ode_res_1 = ode_discipline.execute()

# %%
# The default inputs of the :class:`.ODEDiscipline` are the default inputs of the
# underlying discipline defining the RHS of the ODE. Therefore, `ode_res_1` contains
# the solution of the problem of a harmonic oscillator with angular velocity `omega`
# equal to :math:`2.0`, with initial position :math:`1.0` and initial velocity
# :math:`0.0`.
#
# Different values for the design variables and for the initial conditions can be
# specified by passing a suitable dictionary to the `execute()` method of the
# class:`ODEDiscipline`.

position_2 = array([2.0])
velocity_2 = array([0.5])
omega_2 = array([1.0])

ode_res_2 = ode_discipline.execute({
    "position": position_2,
    "velocity": velocity_2,
    "omega": omega_2,
})

# %%
# The object `ode_res_2` contains the solution of a different harmonic oscillator
# problem, characterized by an angular velocity `omega` equal to :math:`1.0`, with
# a positive initial velocity of :math:`0.5`, and an initial position deviated by
# :math:`2.0` from the equilibrium.

# %%
# Terminating events
# ..................
#
# In some cases, it can be useful not to pursue the solution of the ODE for the entire
# time interval, but only up to the realization of a certain condition. For example, one
# could be interested in the dynamic of a falling object up to its impact on the ground.
# In solvers like `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, the termination condition is encoded by
# a function with the same entries as the RHS of the ODE, returning a real value.
# The termination condition is fulfilled when the function crosses the threshold
# :math:`0` (for further information, consult `the SciPy documentation
# <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html>`_).
# In |g|, the same result can be achieved by passing a list of disciplines to the
# constructor of :class:`.ODEDiscipline`, each representing a termination condition.
# All disciplines representing termination conditions must have the same inputs as the
# discipline for the dynamic, and one real output.
#
# In this example, we consider a new :class:`.ODEDiscipline`, describing the trajectory
# of a harmonic oscillator from its starting point up to the instant when it crosses
# the equilibrium position.


def termination_function(
    time: ndarray = _time,
    position: ndarray = position_1,
    velocity: ndarray = velocity_1,

termination_discipline = create_discipline(
    "AutoPyDiscipline",
    py_func=termination_function,
    grammar_type=Discipline.GrammarType.SIMPLE,
)

# %%
# Here, `termination_discipline` is the :class:`.AutoPyDiscipline` encoding the
# termination condition. In order to include this condition in the solution of the ODE,
# we pass the tuple `(termination_discipline,)` as the argument
# `termination_event_disciplines` of the constructor of :class:`.ODEDiscipline`.

    return_trajectories=True,
)

ode_res_termination = ode_discipline_termination.execute()
