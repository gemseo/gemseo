Data transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fitting a model from transformed data rather than raw data can facilitate the training
and improve the quality of the machine learning model.
Every machine learning model has a ``transformer`` argument to set the transformation policy (none by default).
In the special case of regression models,
the function :func:`.create_surrogate` and the :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` class
use :attr:`.MLRegressionAlgo.DEFAULT_TRANSFORMER` by default,
i.e. :class:`.MinMaxScaler` for both inputs and outputs.
