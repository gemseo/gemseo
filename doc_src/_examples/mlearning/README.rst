Machine learning
================

This section illustrates the features of the :mod:`gemseo.mlearning` package:

- how to create a machine learning model for classification, clustering or regression,
- how to transform the data,
- how to assess the quality of a model,
- how to tune a model.

This package is particularly useful for creating a surrogate model,
as a :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` wraps a regression model built from it.
However,
for those who are not very comfortable with machine learning
and for those who are essentially interested in the surrogate modelling,
starting with :ref:`the examples <surrogate_discipline_examples>`
about the :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` should be more relevant.
