Use a data converter

# %%
# Why?
# ----
#
# By default,
# the types of the coupling variables can be either numbers or 1D NumPy array.
# With custom data converters,
# one can add support to other types.
# For instance,
# to support 2D NumPy arrays,
# the following specialized data converter could be derived.


class DataConverter(JSONGrammarDataConverter):
    """A data converter where some coupling variables are 2D NumPy arrays."""

    # The names of the coupling variables that are 2D NumPy arrays.
    NAMES_WITH_2D_ARRAY = ("a_coupling_variable_name", "another_coupling_variable_name")

    # The shape of the 2D NumPy arrays.
    SHAPE = (2, 2)

    def convert_value_to_array(self, name, value):
        if name in self.NAMES_WITH_2D_ARRAY:
            return value.flatten()
        return super().convert_value_to_array(name, value)

    def convert_array_to_value(self, name, array_):
        if name in self.NAMES_WITH_2D_ARRAY:
            return array_.reshape(self.SHAPE)
        return super().convert_array_to_value(name, array_)


# %%
# Use the converter
# ----
#
# In order to be used,
# the custom data converter shall be set to the grammar class.
# The above custom data converter is defined for grammars of type JSONGrammar since
# it derives from JSONGrammarDataConverter.
# Declare the custom data converter with

JSONGrammar.DATA_CONVERTER_CLASS = DataConverter

# This shall be done the earliest,
# before any grammar is instantiated.
