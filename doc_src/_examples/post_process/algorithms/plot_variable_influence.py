Variables influence
===================

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.VariableInfluence` plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.VariableInfluence` post-processing performs first-order variable
influence analysis.

The method computes
:math:`\frac{d f}{d x_i} \cdot \left(x_{i_*} - x_{initial_design}\right)`, where
:math:`x_{initial_design}` is the initial value of the
variable and :math:`x_{i_*}` is the optimal value of the variable.
