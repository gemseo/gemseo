Constraints history
===================

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.ConstraintsHistory`
post-processing on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.ConstraintsHistory` post-processing plots the history of the constraints
functions specified by the user with respect to the iteration. Each constraint history
is represented in a subplot where the background color gives qualitative indications
on the constraint violation: areas where the constraint is active are white, the ones
where it is violated ones are red and the ones where it is satisfied are green.

This post-processing provides more precise information on the constraints than
:class:`.OptHistoryView` but scales less with the number of constraints.
