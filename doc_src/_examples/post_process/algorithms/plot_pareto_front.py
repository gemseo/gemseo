Pareto front
=============

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.ParetoFront` plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

# Import
# ------
# The first step is to import a high-level function for logging.

configure_logger()

# %%
# Description
# -----------
#
# The :class:`.ParetoFront` post-processing generates
# a plot or a matrix of plots (if there are more than
# 2 objectives). It indicates in red the locally non-dominated points for the
# current objectives, and in green the globally (all objectives) Pareto optimal
# points.

# %%
# Create disciplines
# ------------------
# At this point, we instantiate the disciplines of Sobieski's SSBJ problem:
# :class:`.SobieskiPropulsion`, :class:`.SobieskiAerodynamics`,
# :class:`.SobieskiStructure` and :class:`.SobieskiMission`.
disciplines = create_discipline([
    "SobieskiPropulsion",
    "SobieskiAerodynamics",
    "SobieskiStructure",
    "SobieskiMission",
])

# %%
# Create design space
# -------------------
# We also create the :class:`.SobieskiDesignSpace`.
design_space = SobieskiDesignSpace()

# %%
# Create and execute scenario
# ---------------------------
# The next step is to build an MDO scenario in order to maximize the range,
# encoded 'y_4', with respect to the design parameters, while satisfying the
# inequality constraints 'g_1', 'g_2' and 'g_3'. We can use the MDF formulation,
# the SLSQP optimization algorithm
# and a maximum number of iterations equal to 100.
scenario = create_scenario(
    disciplines,
    formulation="MDF",
    objective_name="y_4",
    maximize_objective=True,
    design_space=design_space,
)
scenario.set_differentiation_method()
for constraint in ["g_1", "g_2", "g_3"]:
    scenario.add_constraint(constraint, "ineq")
scenario.execute({"algo": "SLSQP", "max_iter": 10})

# %%
# Post-process scenario
# ---------------------
# Lastly, we post-process the scenario by means of the :class:`.ParetoFront`.

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    Each post-processing method requires different inputs and offers a variety
#    of customization options. Use the high-level function
#    :func:`.get_post_processing_options_schema` to print a table with
#    the options for any post-processing algorithm.
#    Or refer to our dedicated page:
#    :ref:`gen_post_algos`.
