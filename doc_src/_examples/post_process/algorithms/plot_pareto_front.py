Pareto front
=============

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.ParetoFront` plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.ParetoFront` post-processing provides a matrix of plots (if there are more
than 2 objectives). It indicates in red the locally non-dominated points for the current
objective, and in green the globally (all objectives) Pareto optimal points.
