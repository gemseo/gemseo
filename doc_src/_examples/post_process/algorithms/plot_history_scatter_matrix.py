Scatter plot matrix
===================

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.ScatterPlotMatrix`
post-processing on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.ScatterPlotMatrix` post-processing provide the scatter plot matrix among
design variables and outputs functions. Each non-diagonal block represents the samples
according to the x- and y- coordinates names while the diagonal ones approximate
the probability distributions of the variables, using a kernel-density estimator.
