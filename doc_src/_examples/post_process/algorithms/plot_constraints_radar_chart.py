Radar chart
===========

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.RadarChart` post-processing
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.RadarChart` post-processing plots the constraints functions specified by
the user, at a given iteration, on a radar style chart.

By default, the last iteration is used. This post-processing of the constraints scales
better with the number of constraints than the constraint plot provided by the
:class:`.OptHistoryView`.
