Correlations
============

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.Correlations` post-processing
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

A correlation coefficient indicates whether there is a linear relationship between two
quantities :math:`x` and :math:`y`. It is the normalized covariance between the two
quantities defined as:

.. math::

   R_{xy}=\frac {\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})(y_i-{\bar{y}})}{ns_{x}s_{y}}
   =\frac {\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})(y_i-{\bar{y}})}{\sqrt {\sum
   \limits _{i=1}^n(x_i-{\bar{x}})^{2}\sum \limits _{i=1}^n(y_i-{\bar{y}})^{2}}}

The :class:`.Correlations` post-processing provides scatter plots of correlated
variables among design variables, outputs functions, and constraints.

By default, only the variables with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.95 are
considered. The threshold value can be modified in the post-processing settings.
