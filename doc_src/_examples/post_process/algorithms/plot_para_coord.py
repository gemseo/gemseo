Parallel coordinates
====================

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.ParallelCoordinates` plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.ParallelCoordinates` post-processing provides parallel coordinates plots
among design variables, outputs functions and constraints.

The :class:`.ParallelCoordinates` portrays the design variables history during the
scenario execution. Each vertical coordinate is dedicated to a design variable,
normalized by its bounds.

A polyline joins all components of a given design vector and is colored by objective
function values. This highlights the correlations between the values of the design
variables and the values of the objective function.
