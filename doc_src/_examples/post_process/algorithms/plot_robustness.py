Robustness
==========

In this example, we illustrate the use of the :class:`.Robustness` plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

The :class:`.Robustness` post-processing plots the robustness of the optimum in a box
plot. Using the quadratic approximations of all the output functions, we propagate
analytically a normal distribution with 1% standard deviation on all the design
variables, assuming no cross-correlations of inputs, to obtain the mean and standard
deviation of the resulting normal distribution. A series of samples are randomly
generated from the resulting distribution, whose quartiles are plotted, relatively to
the values of the function at the optimum. For each function (in abscissa), the plot
shows the extreme values encountered in the samples (top and bottom bars). Then, 95% of
the values are within the blue boxes. The average is given by the red bar.
