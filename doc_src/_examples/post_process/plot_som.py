# Description
# -----------
#
# The :class:`~gemseo.post.som.SOM` post-processing performs a Self Organizing Map
# clustering on the optimization history.
# A :class:`~gemseo.post.som.SOM` is a 2D representation of a design of experiments
# which requires dimensionality reduction since it may be in a very high dimension.
#
# A :term:`SOM` is built by using an unsupervised artificial neural network
# :cite:`Kohonen:2001`.
# A map of size ``n_x.n_y`` is generated, where
# ``n_x`` is the number of neurons in the :math:`x` direction and ``n_y``
# is the number of neurons in the :math:`y` direction. The design space
# (whatever the dimension) is reduced to a 2D representation based on
# ``n_x.n_y`` neurons. Samples are clustered to a neuron when their design
# variables are close in terms of their L2 norm. A neuron is always located at the
# same place on a map. Each neuron is colored according to the average value for
# a given criterion. This helps to qualitatively analyze whether parts of the design
# space are good according to some criteria and not for others, and where
# compromises should be made. A white neuron has no sample associated with
# it: not enough evaluations were provided to train the SOM.
#
# SOM's provide a qualitative view of the :term:`objective function`, the
# :term:`constraints`, and of their relative behaviors.

# Create disciplines
# ------------------
# At this point, we instantiate the disciplines of Sobieski's SSBJ problem:
# Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Structure and Mission
disciplines = create_discipline(
    [
        "SobieskiPropulsion",
        "SobieskiAerodynamics",
        "SobieskiStructure",

# Create design space
# -------------------
# We also read the design space from the :class:`.SobieskiProblem`.
design_space = SobieskiProblem().design_space

# Create and execute scenario
# ---------------------------
# The next step is to build an MDO scenario in order to maximize the range,
# encoded 'y_4', with respect to the design parameters, while satisfying the
# inequality constraints 'g_1', 'g_2' and 'g_3'. We can use the MDF formulation,
# the Monte Carlo DOE algorithm and 30 samples.

for constraint in ["g_1", "g_2", "g_3"]:
    scenario.add_constraint(constraint, "ineq")
scenario.execute({"algo": "OT_MONTE_CARLO", "n_samples": 30})

###############################################################################
# Post-process scenario
# ---------------------
# Lastly, we post-process the scenario by means of the
# :class:`~gemseo.post.som.SOM` plot which performs a self organizing map
# clustering on optimization history.

###############################################################################
# .. tip::
#
#    Each post-processing method requires different inputs and offers a variety
#    of customization options. Use the API function
#    :meth:`~gemseo.api.get_post_processing_options_schema` to print a table with
#    the options for any post-processing algorithm.
#    Or refer to our dedicated page:
#    :ref:`gen_post_algos`.

scenario.post_process("SOM", save=False, show=False)
# Workaround for HTML rendering, instead of ``show=True``

# Figure :ref:`fig-ssbj-mdf-som100` illustrates another :term:`SOM` on the Sobieski
# use case. The optimization method is a (costly) derivative free algorithm
# (``NLOPT_COBYLA``), indeed all the relevant information for the optimization
# is obtained at the cost of numerous evaluations of the functions. For
# more details, please read the paper by
# :cite:`kumano2006multidisciplinary` on wing MDO post-processing
# using SOM.

# A DOE may also be a good way to produce SOM maps.
# Figure :ref:`fig-ssbj-mdf-som10000` shows an example with 10000 points on
# the same test case. This produces more relevant SOM plots.
