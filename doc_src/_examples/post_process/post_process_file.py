Post-process an HDF5 file
=========================
"""
from __future__ import annotations

from gemseo import execute_post

# %%
# We can post-process an HDF5 file
# generated from an :class:`.OptimizationProblem` or a :class:`.Scenario`
# with the function :func:`.execute_post`:
execute_post("my_results.hdf", "BasicHistory", variable_names=["y"])

# %%
# .. note::
#    By default, |g| saves the images on the disk.
#    Use ``save=False`` to not save figures and ``show=True`` to display them on the screen.
