# We consider a minimization problem over the interval :math:`[0,1]`
# of the :math:`f(x)=x^2` objective function:
discipline = create_discipline("AnalyticDiscipline", expressions={"y": "x**2"})

design_space = create_design_space()
design_space.add_variable("x", l_b=0.0, u_b=1.0)

scenario = create_scenario([discipline], "DisciplinaryOpt", "y", design_space)

# %%
# We solve this optimization problem with the gradient-free algorithm COBYLA:
scenario.execute({"algo": "NLOPT_COBYLA", "max_iter": 10})

# %%
# Then,
# we can post-process this :class:`.MDOScenario`
# either with its method :meth:`~.MDOScenario.post_process`:
scenario.post_process("BasicHistory", variable_names=["y"])

# %%
# or with the function :func:`.execute_post`:
execute_post(scenario, "BasicHistory", variable_names=["y"])
