# We consider a minimization problem over the interval :math:`[0,1]`
# of the :math:`f(x)=x^2` objective function:

objective = MDOFunction(lambda x: x**2, "f", input_names=["x"], output_names=["y"])

# %%
# We solve this optimization problem with the gradient-free algorithm COBYLA:
execute_algo(optimization_problem, "NLOPT_COBYLA", max_iter=10)

# %%
# Then,
# we can post-process this :class:`.OptimizationProblem`
# with the function :func:`.execute_post`:
execute_post(optimization_problem, "BasicHistory", variable_names=["y"])
