# We can create the same figures using command line inputs:
#
# .. code::
#
#    gemseo-study mdo_study.xlsx -o outputs -h 5 -w 5 -x -l
#
# where ``gemseo-study`` is an executable provided by |g|
# and the Excel file path ``mdo_study.xlsx`` is the specification of the MDO study.
# Here, we set some options of ``gemseo-study``:
#
# - ``-o outputs`` is the output directory,
# - ``-h 5`` is the height of the N2 chart in inches,
# - ``-w 5`` is the width of the N2 chart in inches,
# - ``-x`` is an option to create of the XDSM
#   (compatible only with the study type 'mdo'),
# - ``-l`` is an option to create a PDF file with the creation of the XDSM.
