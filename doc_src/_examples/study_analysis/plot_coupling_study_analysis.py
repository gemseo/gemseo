#
# We can create the same figures using command line inputs:
#
# .. code::
#
#    gemseo-study coupling_study.xlsx -t coupling -o outputs -h 5 -w 5
#
# where ``gemseo-study`` is an executable provided by |g|
# and the Excel file path ``coupling_study.xlsx`` is the specification
# of the coupling study.
# Here, we set some options of ``gemseo-study``:
#
# - :code:`-t coupling` is the type of study (default: ``mdo``),
# - :code:`-o outputs` is the output directory,
# - :code:`-h 5` is the height of the N2 chart in inches,
# - :code:`-w 5` is the width of the N2 chart in inches.
