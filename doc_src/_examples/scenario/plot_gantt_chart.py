Gantt Chart
===========

In this example, we illustrate the use of the Gantt chart plot
on the Sobieski's SSBJ problem.

# %%
# Import
# ------
# The first step is to import some high-level functions
# and a method to get the design space.

from gemseo.problems.mdo.sobieski.core.design_space import SobieskiDesignSpace

# %%
# Create disciplines
# ------------------
# Then, we instantiate the disciplines of the Sobieski's SSBJ problem:
# Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Structure and Mission
disciplines = create_discipline([
    "SobieskiPropulsion",
    "SobieskiAerodynamics",
    "SobieskiStructure",

# %%
# Create design space
# -------------------
# We also create the :class:`.SobieskiDesignSpace`.
design_space = SobieskiDesignSpace()

# %%
# Create and execute scenario
# ---------------------------
# The next step is to build an MDO scenario in order to maximize the range,
# encoded 'y_4', with respect to the design parameters, while satisfying the
# inequality constraints 'g_1', 'g_2' and 'g_3'. We can use the MDF formulation,
# the SLSQP optimization algorithm
# and a maximum number of iterations equal to 100.

# Note that the formulation settings passed to :func:`.create_scenario` can be provided
# via a Pydantic model. For more information, see :ref:`formulation_settings`.

# %%
# Enable time stamps
# ------------------
# Recording all time stamps is done by default;
# we have to enable it:
ExecutionStatistics.is_time_stamps_enabled = True

scenario.execute(algo_name="SLSQP", max_iter=10)

# %%
# Note that the algorithm settings passed to :meth:`.DriverLibrary.execute` can be provided
# via a Pydantic model. For more information, see :ref:`algorithm_settings`.

# %%
# Post-process scenario
# ---------------------
# Lastly, we plot the Gantt chart.
create_gantt_chart(save=False, show=True)

# Finally, we disable the recording of time stamps for other executions:
ExecutionStatistics.is_time_stamps_enabled = False
