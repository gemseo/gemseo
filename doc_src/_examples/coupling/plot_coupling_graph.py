Coupling graph

This example illustrates the notion of coupling graph.

# %%
# Create the disciplines
# ----------------------
# First,
# we create dummy disciplines that do nothing:
dummy_disciplines = [
    DummyDiscipline(name=name, input_names=input_names, output_names=output_names)
    for (name, input_names, output_names) in (
        ("A", ["a"], ["b"]),
        ("B", ["c"], ["a", "n"]),
        ("C", ["b", "d"], ["c", "e"]),
        ("D", ["f"], ["d", "g"]),
        ("E", ["e"], ["f", "h", "o"]),
        ("F", ["g", "j"], ["i"]),
        ("G", ["i", "h"], ["k", "l"]),
        ("H", ["k", "m"], ["j"]),
        ("I", ["l"], ["m", "w"]),
        ("J", ["n", "o"], ["p", "q"]),
        ("K", ["y"], ["x"]),
        ("L", ["w", "x"], ["y", "z"]),
        ("M", ["p", "s"], ["r"]),
        ("N", ["r"], ["t", "u"]),
        ("O", ["q", "t"], ["s", "v"]),
        ("P", ["u", "v", "z"], ["z"]),
    )
]

# %%
# Generate the coupling graph
# ---------------------------
# The coupling graph represents each discipline by a node
# and each coupling variable by an edge.
# By default,
# the :func:`.generate_coupling_graph` function saves the graphical representation
# of the coupling graph as a PDF file.
# Here,
# we prefer to display it in this web page
# by setting ``file_path`` to ``""``
# (the same would work in a notebook).
generate_coupling_graph(dummy_disciplines)

# %%
# We can also draw the condensed coupling graph,
# where each groups of strongly coupled disciplines is represented by a node:
generate_coupling_graph(dummy_disciplines, file_path="", full=False)
