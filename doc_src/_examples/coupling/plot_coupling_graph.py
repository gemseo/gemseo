# Generate the coupling graph
# ---------------------------
# The coupling graph represents each discipline by a node
# and each coupling variable by an edge.
# By default,
# the :func:`.generate_coupling_graph` function saves the graphical representation
# of the coupling graph as a PDF file.
# Here,
# we prefer to display it in this web page
# by setting ``file_path`` to ``""``
# (the same would work in a notebook).
generate_coupling_graph(disciplines, file_path="")

# %%
# We can also draw the condensed coupling graph,
# where each groups of strongly coupled disciplines is represented by a node:
generate_coupling_graph(disciplines, file_path="", full=False)
