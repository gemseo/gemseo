# %%
# Generate the N2 chart
# ---------------------
# The N2 chart is a tabular way to visualize multidisciplinary coupling variables.
# The disciplines are located on the diagonal of the chart
# while the coupling variables are situated on the other blocks of the matrix view.
# A coupling variable is outputted by a discipline horizontally
# and enters another vertically.
#
# In the classical representation,
# a blue diagonal block represents a self-coupled discipline,
# *i.e.* a discipline having some of its outputs as inputs.
#
# Because of its tabular structure,
# the N2 chart is hard to analyze when the number of disciplines increases.
# This is the reason why in this example,
# we propose to use an interactive representation in a web browser:
generate_n2_plot(disciplines, save=False, show_html=True)
