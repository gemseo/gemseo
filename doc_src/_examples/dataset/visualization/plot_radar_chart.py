# Build a dataset
# ---------------
# Let us consider two series of values for the variables *x1*, *x2* and *x3*
# which we arrange in rows in a :class:`.Dataset`:
dataset = Dataset()
dataset.add_variable("x1", array([[0.2, 0.4, 0.5], [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]]))
dataset.add_variable("x2", array([[0.6], [0.5]]))
dataset.add_variable("x3", array([[0.8], [0.7]]))
dataset.index = ["series_1", "series_2"]

# %%
# Plot the two series on a radar chart
# ------------------------------------
# We can use a :class:`.RadarChart` to display these series,
# with one color per series and the values grouped by variable name:
plot = RadarChart(dataset, connect=True, radial_ticks=True)
plot.rmin = -0.5
plot.rmax = 1.0
plot.execute(save=False, show=True)
