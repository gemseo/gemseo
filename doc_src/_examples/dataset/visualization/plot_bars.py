# Build a dataset
# ---------------
# Let us consider two series of values for the variables *x1*, *x2* and *x3*
# which we arrange in rows in a :class:`.Dataset`:
dataset = Dataset()
dataset.add_variable("x1", array([[0.25, 0.35], [0.75, 0.85]]))
dataset.add_variable("x2", array([[0.5], [0.5]]))
dataset.add_variable("x3", array([[0.75], [0.25]]))
dataset.index = ["series_1", "series_2"]
dataset

# %%
# Plot the two series on a bar chart
# ----------------------------------
# We can use the :class:`.BarPlot` to display these series,
# with one color per series and the values grouped by variable name:
plot = BarPlot(dataset, n_digits=2)
plot.colormap = "PiYG"
plot.execute(save=False, show=True)
