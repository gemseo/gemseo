Interactive visualization using plotly
======================================

By default,
|g| uses `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ for data visualization.
However,
for web-based interactive visualizations,
`plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`__ can be appreciated.
For this reason,
|g| proposes plotly versions of some visualizations
which can be generated using the option ``file_format="html"``
of the method :meth:`.DatasetPlot.execute`.
In that case,
this method returns a list of plotly figures.
When ``save=True`` (default), the figures are saved on the disk.
When ``show=True``, the figures are displayed in the web browser.

from gemseo.post.dataset.bars import BarPlot

# %%
# In this example,
# we create a simple dataset:
dataset = Dataset()
dataset.add_variable("x1", array([[0.25, 0.35], [0.75, 0.85]]))
dataset.add_variable("x2", array([[0.5], [0.5]]))
dataset.add_variable("x3", array([[0.75], [0.25]]))
dataset.index = ["series_1", "series_2"]

# %%
# then,
# we create a :class:`.BarPlot`:
plot = BarPlot(dataset, n_digits=2)
plot.colormap = "PiYG"

# %%
# generate the plotly figure:
plotly_figure = plot.execute(save=False, file_format="html")[0]

# %%
# and visualize it:
plotly_figure

# %%
# .. warning::
#
#    The plotly figures can be truncated both at the bottom and on the right
#    in the web documentation.
#    This an issue related to the documentation plugin. The problem is
#    solved by resizing the window.
#    Alternatively, setting ``show=True`` will display the figure in a
#    new tab of your web browser.
