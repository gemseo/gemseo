Convert a cache to a dataset
============================

In this example,
we will see how to convert a cache to a :class:`.Dataset`.

# Let us consider a :class:`.MemoryFullCache` storing two parameters:
#
# - x with dimension 1 which is a cache input,
# - y with dimension 2 which is a cache output.

cache = MemoryFullCache()
cache[{"x": array([1.0])}] = ({"y": array([2.0, 3.0])}, None)
cache[{"x": array([4.0])}] = ({"y": array([5.0, 6.0])}, None)

# %%
# This cache can be converted to an :class:`.IODataset`
# using its method :meth:`~.MemoryFullCache.to_dataset`:
dataset = cache.to_dataset("toy_cache")
print(dataset)

# %%
# The input variables belong to the input group
# and the output variables to the output group.
# We can avoid this categorization and simply build a :class:`.Dataset`:
dataset = cache.to_dataset("toy_cache", categorize=False)
print(dataset)
