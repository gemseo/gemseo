Design space
============

In this example, we will discover the different functions of the API related to
design space, which is a key element to represent the space of parameters on
which a scenario will evaluate a list of disciplines.

# Create a design space
# ---------------------
#
# To create a standard :class:`.DesignSpace`,
# the API function :func:`.create_design_space` can be used.
#
# - This function does not take any argument.
# - This function returns an empty instance of :class:`.DesignSpace`.
design_space = create_design_space()
print(design_space)

# %%
# Once built, we can add variables. E.g.

design_space.add_variable(
    "x", 2, l_b=array([0.0] * 2), u_b=array([1.0] * 2), value=array([0.5] * 2)
)
print(design_space)

# %%
# Read a design space
# -------------------
# In presence of a design space specified in a CSV file,
# the API function :func:`.read_design_space` can be used.
#
# - Its first argument is the file path of the design space.
#   Its second argument is the list of fields available in the file
#   and is optional.
# - By default, the design space reads these information from the file.
# - This function returns an instance of :class:`.DesignSpace`.
design_space.to_csv("saved_design_space.csv")
loaded_design_space = read_design_space("saved_design_space.csv")

# %%
# Write a design space
# --------------------
#
# To export an instance of :class:`.DesignSpace` into an HDF or CSV file,
# the :func:`.write_design_space` API function can be used:
loaded_design_space.add_variable("y", l_b=-1, u_b=3, value=0.0)
write_design_space(loaded_design_space, "saved_design_space.csv")
print(read_design_space("saved_design_space.csv"))
