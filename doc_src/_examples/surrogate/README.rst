Surrogate discipline
====================

This section illustrates
how to create and use a :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline`.

This :class:`.Discipline` implements the notion of surrogate model,
mainly used to approximate an expensive discipline from samples.

A :class:`.SurrogateDiscipline` wraps a regression model
built from the :mod:`gemseo.mlearning` package.
For those who are interested in machine learning techniques,
such as data transformation and model assessment,
please refer to :ref:`the corresponding examples <machine_learning_examples>`.
