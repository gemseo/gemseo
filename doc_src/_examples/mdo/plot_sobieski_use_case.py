# This section describes how to setup and solve the MDO problem relative to the
# :ref:`Sobieski test case <sobieski_problem>` with |g|.
#
# .. seealso::
#
#    To begin with a more simple MDO problem, and have a detailed description
#    of how to plug a test case to |g|, see :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_mdo_plot_sellar.py`.
#

#
# Solving with an :ref:`MDF formulation <mdf_formulation>`
# --------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this example, we solve the range optimization using the following
# :ref:`MDF formulation <mdf_formulation>`:
#
# - The :ref:`MDF formulation <mdf_formulation>` couples all the disciplines
#   during the :ref:`mda` at each optimization iteration.
# - All the :term:`design variables` are equally treated, concatenated in a
#   single vector and given to a single :term:`optimization algorithm` as the
#   unknowns of the problem.
# - There is no specific :term:`constraint` due to the :ref:`MDF formulation
#   <mdf_formulation>`.
# - Only the design :term:`constraints` :math:`g\_1`, :math:`g\_2` and
#   :math:`g\_3` are added to the problem.
# - The :term:`objective function` is the range (the :math:`y\_4` variable in
#   the model), computed after the :ref:`mda`.
#
# Imports
# -------
# All the imports needed for the tutorials are performed here.
# Note that some of the imports are related to the Python 2/3 compatibility.

# Step 1: :class:`.Discipline` creation.
# --------------------------------------
#
# To build the scenario, we first instantiate the disciplines. Here, the
# disciplines themselves have already been
# developed and interfaced with |g| (see :ref:`benchmark_problems`).

disciplines = create_discipline([
    "SobieskiPropulsion",
    "SobieskiAerodynamics",

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    For the disciplines that are not interfaced with |g|, the |g|'s
#    :mod:`~gemseo` module eases the creation of disciplines without having
#    to import them.
#
#    See :ref:`api`.

# %%
# Step 2: :class:`.Scenario` creation.
# ------------------------------------
#
# The scenario delegates the creation of the optimization problem to the
# :ref:`MDO formulation <mdo_formulations>`.
#
# Therefore, it needs the list of ``disciplines``, the names of the formulation,
# the name of the objective function and the design space.
#
# - The ``design_space`` (shown below for reference, as ``design_space.txt``)
#   defines the unknowns of the optimization problem, and their bounds. It contains
#   all the design variables needed by the :ref:`MDF formulation <mdf_formulation>`.
#   It can be imported from a text file, or created from scratch with the methods
#   :func:`.create_design_space` and
#   :meth:`.DesignSpace.add_variable`. In this case,
#   we will create it directly from the API.

# - The available :ref:`MDO formulations <mdo_formulations>` are located in the
#   **gemseo.formulations** package, see :ref:`extending-gemseo` for extending
#   GEMSEO with other formulations.
# - The ``formulation`` class name (here, ``"MDF"``) shall be passed to
#   the scenario to select them.
# - The list of available formulations can be obtained by using
#   :func:`.get_available_formulations`.
get_available_formulations()
# %%
# - :math:`y\_4` corresponds to the ``objective_name``. This name must be one
#   of the disciplines outputs, here the "SobieskiMission" discipline. The list of
#   all outputs of the disciplines can be obtained by using
#   :meth:`~gemseo.utils.discipline.get_all_outputs`:
get_all_outputs(disciplines)
get_all_inputs(disciplines)
# %%
# From these :class:`.Discipline`, design space filename,
# :ref:`MDO formulation <mdo_formulations>` name and objective function name,
# we build the scenario.
# During the instantiation of the scenario, we provide some options for the
# MDF formulations. The MDF formulation includes an MDA, and thus one of the settings of
# the formulation is ``main_mda_settings``, which configures the solver for the strong
# couplings.
main_mda_settings = MDAGaussSeidel_Settings(
    tolerance=1e-14,
    max_mda_iter=50,
    warm_start=True,
    use_lu_fact=False,
    linear_solver_tolerance=1e-14,
)
scenario = create_scenario(
    disciplines,
    "y_4",
    design_space,
    formulation_name="MDF",
    maximize_objective=True,
    main_mda_settings=main_mda_settings,
)
# %%
# The range function (:math:`y\_4`) should be maximized. However, optimizers
# minimize functions by default. Which is why, when creating the scenario, the argument
# ``maximize_objective`` shall be set to ``True``.
#
# Scenario options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We may provide additional options to the scenario:
#
#
# **Function derivatives.** As analytical disciplinary derivatives are
# available for Sobieski test-case, they can be used instead of computing
# the derivatives with finite differences or with the complex step method.
# The easiest way to set it is the method
# :meth:`.BaseScenario.set_differentiation_method`:
scenario.set_differentiation_method()
# %%
#
# The default behavior uses the analytical derivatives defined in
# :meth:`.Discipline._compute_jacobian`. Otherwise, the finite differences method can
# be set as follows:
#
# .. code::
#
#   scenario.set_differentiation_method("finite_differences",1e-7)
#
# It is also possible to differentiate functions by means of the
# :term:`complex step` method:
#
# .. code::
#
#   scenario.set_differentiation_method("complex_step",1e-30j)
#
# Constraints
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Similarly to the objective function, the constraints names are a subset
# of the disciplines' outputs. They can be obtained by using
# :meth:`~gemseo.utils.discipline.get_all_outputs`.
#
# The formulation has a powerful feature to automatically dispatch the constraints
# (:math:`g\_1, g\_2, g\_3`) and plug them to the optimizers depending on
# the formulation. To do that, we use the method
# :meth:`.BaseScenario.add_constraint`:
for constraint in ["g_1", "g_2", "g_3"]:
    scenario.add_constraint(constraint, constraint_type="ineq")
# %%
# Step 3: Execution and visualization of the results
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# The scenario is executed from
# an optimization algorithm name (see :ref:`gen_opt_algos`),
# a maximum number of iterations
# and possibly a few options.
# The maximum number of iterations and the options can be passed
# either as keyword arguments
# e.g. ``scenario.execute(algo_name="NLOPT_SLSQP", max_iter=10, ftol_rel=1e-6)``
# or as a Pydantic model of settings,
# e.g. ``scenario.execute(NLOPT_SLSQP_Settings(max_iter=10, ftol_rel=1e-6))``
# where the Pydantic model ``NLOPT_SLSQP_Settings`` is imported from
# ``gemseo.settings.opt``.
# In this example, we use the Pydantic model:
slsqp_settings = NLOPT_SLSQP_Settings(
    max_iter=10,
    ftol_rel=1e-10,
    ineq_tolerance=2e-3,
    normalize_design_space=True,
)
scenario.execute(slsqp_settings)
# %%
# Post-processing options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# A whole variety of visualizations may be displayed for both MDO and DOE
# scenarios. These features are illustrated on the SSBJ use case in
# :ref:`post_processing`.
#
# To visualize the optimization history:
scenario.post_process(post_name="OptHistoryView", save=False, show=True)

# %%
# Influence of gradient computation method on performance
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# As mentioned in :ref:`jacobian_assembly`, several methods
# are available in order to perform  the gradient computations: classical finite
# differences, complex step and :ref:`mda` linearization in direct or adjoint mode.
# These modes are automatically selected by |g| to minimize the CPU time. Yet, they
# can be forced on demand in each :ref:`mda`:
scenario.formulation.mda.linearization_mode = JacobianAssembly.DerivationMode.DIRECT
scenario.formulation.mda.matrix_type = JacobianAssembly.JacobianType.LINEAR_OPERATOR
# %%
# The method used to solve the adjoint or direct linear problem may also be selected.
# |g| can either assemble a sparse residual Jacobian matrix of the :ref:`mda` from the
# disciplines matrices. This has the advantage that LU factorizations may be stored to
# solve multiple right hand sides problems in a cheap way. But this requires
# extra memory.
scenario.formulation.mda.matrix_type = JacobianAssembly.JacobianType.MATRIX
scenario.formulation.mda.use_lu_fact = True
# %%
# Alternatively, |g| can implicitly create a matrix-vector product operator,
# which is sufficient for GMRES-like solvers. It avoids to create an additional
# data structure. This can also be mandatory if the disciplines do not provide
# full Jacobian matrices but only matrix-vector product operators.
scenario.formulation.mda.matrix_type = JacobianAssembly.JacobianType.LINEAR_OPERATOR
# %%
# The next table shows the performance of each method for solving the Sobieski use case
# with :ref:`MDF <mdf_formulation>` and :ref:`IDF <idf_formulation>` formulations.
# The efficiency of linearization is clearly visible as it takes from 10 to 20 times
# less CPU time to compute analytic derivatives of an :ref:`mda` compared
# to finite difference and complex step.
# For :ref:`IDF <idf_formulation>`, improvements are less consequent,
# but direct linearization is more than 2.5 times faster than other methods.
