# Read a design space from a file
# -------------------------------
#
# The user can read a design space from a file using the
# :func:`.create_design_space` function.


design_space = read_design_space("design_space.txt")
print(design_space)


###############################################################################
# Filtering the design space
# --------------------------
#
# The user can filter the design space in order to only keep some variables. To
# do so, the user can use the :meth:`.DesignSpace.filter` method:

design_space.filter(["x1", "x2"])
print(design_space)

###############################################################################
# Export the design space
# -----------------------
#
# The user can export a :class:`.DesignSpace` instance by using the
# :func:`.export_design_space` function.


export_design_space(design_space, "new_design_space.txt")
