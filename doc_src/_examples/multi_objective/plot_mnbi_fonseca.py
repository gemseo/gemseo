Multi-objective Fonseca-Fleming example with the mNBI algorithm
===============================================================

In this example, the modified Normal Boundary Intersection algorithm (mNBI) is used to
solve the :class:`.FonsecaFleming` optimization problem :cite:`fonseca1995overview`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \text{minimize the objective function }
   & f_1(x) = 1 - exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{d}((x_i - 1 / sqrt(d)) ^ 2)) \\
   & f_2(x) = 1 + exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{d}((x_i + 1 / sqrt(d)) ^ 2)) \\
   \text{with respect to the design variables }&x\\
   \text{subject to the bound constraint}
   & x\in[-4,4]^d
   \end{aligned}

We also show how the Pareto front can be refined.
