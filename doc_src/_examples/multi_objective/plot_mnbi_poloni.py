Multi-objective Poloni example with the mNBI algorithm
======================================================

In this example,
the modified Normal Boundary Intersection (mNBI) algorithm is used to
solve the :class:`.Poloni` problem :cite:`POLONI2000403`:

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
    &a1 = 0.5 * sin(1) - 2 * cos(1) + sin(2) - 1.5 * cos(2)\\
    &a2 = 1.5 * sin(1) - cos(1) + 2 * sin(2) - 0.5 * cos(2)\\
    &b1(x, y) = 0.5 * sin(x) - 2 * cos(x) + sin(y) - 1.5 * cos(y)\\
    &b2(x, y) = 1.5 * sin(x) - cos(x) + 2 * sin(y) - 0.5 * cos(y)\\
    \text{minimize the objective function}\\
    & f_1(x, y) = 1 + (a1 - b1(x,y)^2 + (a2 - b2(x,y))^2 \\
    & f_2(x, y) = (x + 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 \\
    \text{with respect to the design variables }\\
    &x \\
    \text{subject to the bound constraints }\\
    & -\pi \leq x \leq \pi\\
    & -\pi \leq y \leq \pi
    \end{aligned}

It is an interesting one because its Pareto front is discontinuous.
