Multi-objective Binh-Korn example with the mNBI algorithm
=========================================================

In this example, the modified Normal Boundary Intersection (mNBI) algorithm is used
to solve the :class:`.BinhKorn` problem :cite:`binh1997mobes`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \text{minimize the objective function } & f_1(x, y) = 4x^2 + 4y^2 \\
   & f_2(x, y) = (x-5)^2 + (y-5)^2 \\
   \text{with respect to the design variables }&x,\,y \\
   \text{subject to the general constraints }
   & g_1(x,y) = (x-5)^2 + y^2 \leq 25.0\\
   & g_2(x, y) = (x-8)^2 + (y+3)^2 \geq 7.7\\
   \text{subject to the bound constraints }
   & 0 \leq x \leq 5.0\\
   & 0 \leq y \leq 3.0
   \end{aligned}
